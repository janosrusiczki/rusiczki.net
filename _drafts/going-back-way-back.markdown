## Going back, way back

nov 20 - We have a tradition called "Day Of The Dead" in which we honor dead family members by lighting a candles on their graves. Besides doing this in the graveyard in Baia Sprie (my hometown) where most of the _ are, I usually visit the graveyards in Baia Mare with my wife's family. With my parents we usually made the trip to Ocna Sugatag, where my father's grandparents are burried. In 2021 I was still disoriented after my mother's death to do this, but in 2022 what started out as a trip to the slopes with my wife and daughter ended in Ocna Sugatag. I didn't find the gravestone at first and then found that it fell down. 
dec 2 - We returned on the 2nd of December with my wife, with some tools and tried to right it but quickly discovered it wouldn't be possible as it was very heavy. We had a walk through an old forest next to the village and returned home.
