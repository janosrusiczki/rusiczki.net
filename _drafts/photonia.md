Since I was always passionate about photography and one of the most important moments of my life was [getting my first digital camera](https://www.rusiczki.net/2012/05/17/aventuri-in-fotografia-digitala/), I wanted a photo gallery pretty soon after I started this blog. And checking The Internet Archive I noticed that I actually had a gallery section here on the site and I also have [a post about trying to customize Gallery](https://www.rusiczki.net/2003/02/19/gallery/) and I vaguely remember using that web app to upload some of my photos. But it left a lot to be desired, back then I wanted things to integrate with the layout of the site as tightly as possible and Gallery was not suitable for that.

Then Flickr happened, which was perhaps the first Web 2.0 site I started using. And I was actually deeply fascinated by it and I used it heavily in it's glory days, pre-Facebook. It was actually my first social network where I met and interacted with people I didn't know from before and who were also passionate about their photos and / or photography in general. [I uploaded my first photo at the begining of 2005](https://photos.rusiczki.net/photos/4555559) and used the site very moderately at first because there was a 200 photos limit and the pro option wasn't available because PayPal wasn't available in Romania. Then I convinced my French client whom I was working with back then to buy me a Pro account and the real fun started.

What's next:

- It's still not an MVP, there are many things missing, such as managing tags and albums)
- Allow signing up and commenting via email or your favorite social network
- Try to integrate ActivityPub
