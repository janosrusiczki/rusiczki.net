Since I was always passionate about photography and one of the most important moments of my life was getting my first digital camera I wanted a photo gallery pretty soon after I started this blog. And checking The Internet Archive I noticed that I actually had a gallery section here on the site and I also have [a post about trying to customize Gallery](https://www.rusiczki.net/2003/02/19/gallery/) and I vaguely remember using that web app to upload some of my photos. But it left a lot to be desired.

Then Flickr happened, which was perhaps the first Web 2.0 site I started using. And I was actually deeply fascinated by it and I used it heavily in it's glory days, pre Facebook. It was actually my first social network. Met and interacted with people I didn't know from before who were also passionate about their photos.

What's next:

- It's still not an MVP, there are many things missing, such as managing tags and albums)
- Allow signing up and commenting via email or your favorite social network
- Try to integrate ActivityPub
