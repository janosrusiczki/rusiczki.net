A funny thing about Christmas is that wheter you turn on your TV, radio, open your favourite magazine or web portal you can just feel the vibe. You can feel the people preparing for the event. This is nice. Because unwillingly you get into that vibe too.

Another thing is that if you visit your average supermarket (at least here in Romania) at this date you will most surely find it empty. And I mean EMPTY. The pre-Christmas shopping frenzy is a killer one.
