I did some pre 22 hours browsing today. And after sending an SMS i remembered to check out <a href="http://www.myx.net/static/ro/webcam.htm" title="Cool WebCams, mostly in the winter">Myx.Net's webcams</a> and this made me nearly bang my head into the wall... Seeing so many happy people skiing. Whoaaa. I'm so full of envy right now. Even if Poiana Brasov isn't the cheapest place in my country. I'm still hoping for the snow to get bigger around here. And today my hopes grew together with the sky getting cloudy. Still, nothing happened.

Also I found an article about <a href="http://www.rdsnet.ro" title="RDSNet.ro">my ISP</a> offering <a href="http://www.bumerang.ro/stiri/index.php?id=10185" title="(In Romanian)">a bounty of 1 billion lei</a> (roughly 30.000$) for any information on  those who sabotaged it's network, cutting the fiber optic cable in three places somewehere between Bucharest, Giurgiu and Ploiesti, thus interrupting access for over 4000 broadband and 40000 dial-up clients. Nice. But wouldn't it be logical for an ISP of this size to have at least one backup line? Or the second and third cuts were the backup lines? I don't know. What I do know is that RDS is not working as good as it did in the middle of the summer when I started my dial-up account.
