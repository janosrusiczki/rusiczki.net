Yeah. It seems I'll be responsable of handing out a Christmas present to the trusty gang @ <a href="http://www.drumandbass.ro" title="The Infamous Future Breakbeat Selectah">drumandbass.ro</a>. This present will consist of adding an MP3 mix made by Seb to the database. Which I listened almost all the day. And I can say that it's <b>da bomb</b>! NuSkool Breakz featuring the best names out there (for example now I'm listening to Way Out West's Intensify), seamless mixing and a general good feeling about it. Very nice.

Also I'm getting ready to spend the night in this really nice club, Cuba.
