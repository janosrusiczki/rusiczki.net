And when I say "fuckin' rockaz" I mean **FUCKING ROCKERS**.

Suppose you go to your fave dance club. Suppose you find it stuffed with rockers who came home for the Winter Holidays. But **assume** that you actually want to *dance* and that they're filling up half the dancefloor and you'll be pretty upset. As I am. Even if they cleared up at about 3 o'clock in the morning. When I just caught the vibe...

Catching the vibe = getting drunk as much as to loose your inhi-fuckin-bitions...

It was an adventureous night. At about 3 AM (and something) I went to the disco with some friends. And then at about 4 AM back to that club. And then home. And I still have the conscience to write these. Hehehe. It means I haven't drank THAT much. And this is good news because tomorrow I won't have THAT BAD hangover. Hehehehe. Or, won't I?

OK. Me out...
