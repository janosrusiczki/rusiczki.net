Here's some Christmas fun:

<a href="http://www.miniworldgames.co.uk/index.cfm?page=games.game&game=12" title=":)">Not your average Santa.</a> (He's sober. Not!)

<a href="http://www.happytreefriends.com/watch_kringles/" title="Warning: Extreme Violence!">Some crazy-violent-grouse cartoon stories.</a> (Very nice graphics, sounds and general design. But they are still violent as hell! Go check!)

Plus it seems some researchers definetly ran out of research material and are now publishing this article entitled "<a href="http://www.informatik.fh-hamburg.de/~windle_c/Logologie/MP3-Gefahr/MP3-risk.html" title="Yay!">Ear damage by MP3, DVD and digital television?</a>". Since I listen almost exclusively MP3s, watch a lot of DivX ;-) movies (in which the DVD's soundtrack is once more re-compressed) and also have digital television I should be looking forward for a nice deafness. Cool!
