Warning! Watching the new Bj&ouml;rk video while eating can be dangerous for those with weaker stomachs. Same as Layo & Bushcwacka!'s <i>Love Story</i>. The tunes are great in both cases. As a note, Bj&ouml;rk seems to love having shocking videos. I remember <i>Pagan Poetry</i> and those hooks in her back. Yayks!

At least these videos are different from the boring average.

[ Just caught Ladytron's <i>Seventeen</i> from the beginning. Recording... Average video but cult band! ]
