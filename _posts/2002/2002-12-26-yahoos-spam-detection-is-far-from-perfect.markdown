I was wondering why do I not receive <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com" title="The best site about web development">SitePoint's</a> Tech Times anymore in my Yahoo! Mail account. Well I accidentally checked my bulk mail folder today. And there it were. Two issues. Brilliant! Anyway it's not that bad. I had 22 spam mails of which only these two were erroneously determined.
