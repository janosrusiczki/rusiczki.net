Just about a moment ago I had this really weird dream that it was night but still the moon was shining so bright that you could see as during the day. And I was actually taking pictures and stuff like this. And this is nothing compared to the fact that yesterday in the afternoon I dreamt I was a spy or something like it, and I hid in some weird carvings in the walls and stuff like this. Ah, and before dreaming about the sunny moon I dreamt that I actually received my copy of Muzik for January for which I'm so eagerly waiting.

I have this weird dreams when I force myself to sleep not actually being too tired.
