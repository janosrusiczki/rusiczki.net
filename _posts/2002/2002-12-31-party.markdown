<img src="https://content.rusiczki.net/blogpics/beer_20_pack.jpg" width="200" height="150" border="0" alt="Will it be enough?" class="postimage" /> That last <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2002/12/31/the-new-years-eve-party/">party rant</a> begins to lose sense when I take a peek at that 20 pack I have waiting for me on the hallway. It really gives me courage for the two nights ahead. Two and a half hours and I'm gone.

Oh. Forgot to mention that it's going to be the same old sausage party as usual. Like 10 guys and 4 girls. Great.

But I'm still optimist.

Again, looking at that beer pack makes me even a bigger optimist!
