<p>I'll take a break.<br />
No more partying for a while. Because I'm really afraid that I'm going to drown that neuron of mine. And I don't feel like it anyway. Partying, that is.<br />
Whoa... And it's already Saturday. I'll stay home in the evening and do the usual. Cool / record worthy video trainspotting. Mouse pointer on the record button... It seems I created a cult. My vid captures spread in the whole town. I'm famous! Well actually, no. I'm not.</p>
