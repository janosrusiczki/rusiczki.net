<p>And no, this time it isn't about snow and rain...<br />
Haven't been in the greatest mood yesterday so I haven't posted anything. When I came back from snowboarding which gave my overall feeling a huge lift I was just about to write a new blog entry when I looked out the window. The wrong place at the wrong time... Saw something which put me back where I was when the day started.<br />
Yesteday late in the evening I went to say goodbye to my cousin who left today around noon. He mentioned he's so happy to go back and, man, I believed him!<br />
Today I worked all day. Haven't learned a word. Another exam tomorrow. I have a bad feeling about it. Really bad feeling. Because I haven't liked this class as much as econimics. Haven't been that active. Maybe a miracle? Maybe not. I hope though. I'll see.</p>
