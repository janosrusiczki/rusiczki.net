<p>Oh yes. I did saw '<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0190138" title="IMDB Link">The Whole Nine Yards</a>'. Funny, entertaining, but not a big deal whatsoever.<br />
But after, more like by accident, I saw '<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0230838" title="IMDB Link">Sweet November</a>', a great romantic movie which seemed to feature the perfect romantic story up to a point... But then it turned a bit more into a real life story. Featured Keanu 'I don't know if I hate him or like him after all' Reaves, Charlize 'oh my God who's this girl!?' Theron and English boy Jason 'I have this thick accent' Isaacs. Absolutely great! But it's a known fact that I like romantic movies.</p>
