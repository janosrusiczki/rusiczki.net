<p>Well <a href="http://www.computergames.ro/jocuri.php?optiune=online_games&game=31" title="Cutie Quake in all it's glory">here it is</a> again. I had the 1000th page load. I must be lucky or something...<br />
Also it seems like a bonus pack came out for UT2003. Should grab it. But first I should play the game more. A lot more. Because I really like it. And I do relax playing it after coding my brain off. I'm talking about UT here. Not Cutie Quake...<br />
The only task remaining now is to remember what that other post I lost was about.</p>
