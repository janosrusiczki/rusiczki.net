I made myself a MasterCard. <a href="http://www.bancpost.ro/bp.nsf/ro_rps_rprod_prod05ta.htm" title="BancPost's Taifun Card">The only Romanian MasterCard</a> which allows average Romanian people to shop on the Net. The procedure is rather complicated since you have to transfer the money to a virtual card before going e-shopping but it's still worth it. As soon as I get my hands on the card itself (around the end of next week) I'll get myself a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596002653/026-1593954-2034021" title="MySQL Reference Manual">good MySQL book</a> because I have serious holes in my knowledge about this database management system. And it would be really important to plug those holes as soon as possible.

I don't quite want to think about the price of the book nor the shipment's...

And now yes. I'm going to bed. I planned to go at midnight. And it's almost 2:30 and I have to work a lot tomorrow! And as a lot of work implies an early wake up... Oh, just shut up and go to sleep!
