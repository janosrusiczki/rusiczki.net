I have some acquaintances (because I can't call some people who I usually meet once every two weeks, friends) who were telling me a long time ago about some kind of a snow festival of the Hungarian community. Telling me how great it is. How big of a party it is each year. And asking me to go / come. So the question was asked. And I asked for some time to think about it. Today they woke me up (at 1:30 PM, yeah...) and as the weather was bright and everything I suddenly said: yes. :-)

This is contrary of what I've been actually planning. Saying no, that is. But life is full of surprises. And I love to surprise myself. If no one else surprises me...

I'm really curious how it will turn out. But I guess it won't be bad since as much as I understood it's basically about drinking, partying, drinking, partying and some more drinking and partying. Snowboard will be packed. And we're off to Harghita! Not just now, but thursday. What can I say? I can barely wait!
