Steve Martin:

"I loved Lord Of The Rings. That was a great download."

"Hosting the Oscars for the second time is like making love to a woman the second time. I guess."

"Uuuh! Sorry, I thought I saw a non-celebrity..."

"There are no losers tonight. But we're about to change that."

Lord Of The Rings starts to harvest technical awards again.

I haven't seen many of the movies of tonight's Oscars but I liked <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Cooper%2C+Chris+(I)">Chris Cooper</a> a lot back then, in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0169547" title="One of my favourite movies...">American Beauty</a> and his speech was impressive.

Oh look: J Lo presenting an award...
