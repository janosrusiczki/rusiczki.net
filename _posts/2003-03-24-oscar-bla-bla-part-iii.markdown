Woaaa!!! Now this was an antiwar speech! It gave me the shivers!!! But somehow I knew this would happen. It was a great speech. He's got some guts.

And of course that Steve Martin made a joke about it.

Look. There's Kevin Spacey. Too bad he haven't done anything worthy this year... Hehe. Shrek found a practical use for the statuette it seems.

"This is his ass, these are my lips. *KISS*" :-)

Another technical award for Chicago.

Yes Steve, you're right, Hale Berry is hot.

Adrien Brody... I envy him. That kiss he gave Hale Berry. And taking the statue away from those huge players (Cage, Nicolson, Caine, Day Lewis). Really touching speech. Standing ovation. Fantastic. And I don't know anything about this guy... I should really fill some knowledge holes.

Music. Eminem? Shit. I don't like this...
