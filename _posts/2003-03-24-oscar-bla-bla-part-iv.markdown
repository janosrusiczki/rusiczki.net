<p>Peter O'Toole. Oh. He's, well, old. But a great actor nonetheless.<br />
The 'Bowling for Columbine' speech is up. Here it goes.</p>
<blockquote><p><i> Whoa. On behalf of our producers Kathleen Glynn and Michael Donovan from Canada, I'd like to thank the Academy for this. I have invited my fellow documentary nominees on the stage with us, and we would like to � they're here in solidarity with me because we like nonfiction. We like nonfiction and we live in fictitious times. We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elects a fictitious president. We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons. Whether it's the fictition of duct tape or fictition of orange alerts we are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Mr. Bush, shame on you. And any time you got the Pope and the Dixie Chicks against you, your time is up. Thank you very much. </i></p></blockquote>
<p>Best actress after the commercials... Waiting.<br />
OK. Presenting is Denzel Washington. Who's gonna be!? I keep my fingers crossed for Renee... But it's Nicole Kidman. For her role in a movie I haven't seen. She's not one of my favourites. Quite nice speech though.<br />
The Academy's president. Mentioning the war of course.<br />
Calista Flockhart and Harrison Ford? He could be her daddy...<br />
The Oscar remember reminded me that Mr. Nicolson is the only one with 3 Oscars. And that Mira Sorvino's got an Oscar (?).<br />
Here comes the most important part of the show. And The Pianist get another award for Adapted Screenplay.<br />
Original screenplay. Ben Affleck gives the statuette to Pedro Almodovar. Who delivers another short pro-peace speech.<br />
Adrien Brody's <a href="http://www.oscar.com/oscarnight/winners/win_32290.html" title="Touching...">speech</a> is up.<br />
Best director. Polanski. The pianist gets yet another award! Followed by a standing ovation.<br />
Best picture. Presented by the Douglas family. ??? I'm so very curious. Chicago. Yep.<br />
Good night. Or morning... Whatever.</p>
