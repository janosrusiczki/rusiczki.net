<a title="Yahoo! TV: Entertainment News & Gossip - 'TIME-TRAVELER' BUSTED FOR INSIDER TRADING" href="http://tv.yahoo.com/news/wwn/20030319/104808600007.html"> 'TIME-TRAVELER' BUSTED FOR INSIDER TRADING</a>

This is funny and weird. But the following phrase really grabbed my attention:

<blockquote>Officials are quite confident the "time-traveler's" claims are bogus. Yet the SEC source admits, "No one can find any record of any Andrew Carlssin existing anywhere before December 2002."</p></blockquote>
Whoops.

He offered to talk about the whereabouts of Bin Laden and the cure for AIDS. But he refuses to tell where his "time craft" is.

Interesting story!
