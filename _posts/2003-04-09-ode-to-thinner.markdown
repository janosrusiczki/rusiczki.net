<p>Sometimes I'm amazed by the quality of music you can find for free on the Internet. And the lack of quality of the music you can buy in shops...<br />
And the good thing is that you can always discover new music on the Internet. New music which you'll like. I visited one of my favourite netlabels one of these days, <a href="http://www.tokyodawnrecords.com">tokydawn records</a> just to find out they haven't updated since December last year. That's sad. Because they've put out such great material over the time, and I'm the proud owner of almost all the tunes they've released! Disappointed by the lack of recent updates I went to their links section and from there I hopped to <a href="http://www.thinnerism.com/">Thinner</a> where I found these wonderful deep house tracks.<br />
I've been looking for stuff like this for a while... Deep house that is. And now the MP3s are sitting nicely on my hard drive. Cute!</p>
