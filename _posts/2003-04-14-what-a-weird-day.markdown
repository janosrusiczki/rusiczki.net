It started at around 2PM. That's when I woke up. After staying up until around 5 in the morning. I got up. Sat down in front of the computer and actually worked a little on version two of <a href="http://www.resurseweb.net/" title="Great Romanian tutorial site! ;-)">resurseweb.net</a>. [ <b>UPDATE</b> Resurseweb.net doesn't exist anymore. The domain is now owned by some porn site. ]

I received a call from a guy. He reminded me that we set a meeting for today to shoot some pics for the local newspaper. I met him at around 5'o clock. And I took some pics of the local karate team. And then we went to a family. Except the mother they were all (father, son, daughter) winners at ski competitions (local of course). I took the pics. Drank a little wine. Then we came to my house. Wrote the pics onto a CD. I was such in a good mood that I called a friend to go out somewhere. Actually I was such in a good mood that I <i>knew</i> something bad will happen... And then, the mistakes started.

I looked at my digital camera and thought: "hey, let's get that" (mistake #1). So I took it with me. Without it's case (mistake #2). At my friend's house I put it in my shirt's pocket (mistake #3). On the street I saw two dogs. One chasing another. And they reached a place out of my sight of view where they started fighting. So I made three jumps. To see something of the fight (fourth and final mistake).

Just as the thougt passed my mind I listened horrified to the sound of my camera crashing on the concrete...

<b>SHIT</b>

Fortunately nothing functional broke. But the outside (mostly the corners) got scratched badly. I'll never succeed selling it that's one sure thing. :-(

Well... This is it.
