<p>The advantage of having about 12 music channels which you can zap at your will is that you can always find (especially at 4:20 in the morning waiting for a boring download to finish on your not-so-good-but-not-bad-either dial-up line) something to karaoke on. And there's one more advantage. I live in house built of huge stones. Walls are on average about 1 meter thick. So no problems arise with my parents.<br />
Poor furniture in my room. It has to listen to my cries. Ahahaha. Now back to some more "singing".</p>
