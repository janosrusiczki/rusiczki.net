<p>Well, to tell the truth I lost count. I lost count how many times I restarted blogging. But it wasn't always my fault.</p>
<p>The first time I tried my luck at blogging I was using <a href="http://www.blogger.com" title="Oldies goldies">Blogger</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rusiczkij/">my dinosaur age account</a> I have at <a href="http://www.geocities.com" title="Yuk!">Geocities</a>. It all went well, I posted some entries being fascinated by what Blogger was offering for free but then Geocities cut FTP access to the free accounts.</p>
<p>A rather long pause followed. In the meantime I started my own "do some good for the people and all this for free" site, resurseweb.net (which can be translated as webresources.net). After a while I saw an installation of <a href="http://cafelog.com/" title="A nice weblog tool written in PHP">b2</a> on a friend's site and I thought: hey what the hell, let's start bloggin again. I installed b2. Posted a few entries, but browsing around the web I noticed that almost everyone was using this "magic tool" called <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a>. First I didn't like it. And that's mostly because I saw the extension that always scares me: cgi. Later I found out that MT was written in Perl. And there was a fairly extensive  install guide on their site. So one night I gave it a shot. Some of the Perl modules which were needed weren't installed on the server I installed the system then. But I got them installed somehow. Anyway, I got myself a working Movable Type installation which I happily used. Rather intensively around Christmas in fact. Posting all those "in progress" Christmas tree pictures. Haha.</p>
<p>The domain expired this year. I didn't renewed it. It looks rather funny if I take a look at it now. Owned by some porn site... I don't know what they were thinking but hey I feel good that they considered my humble site worthy enough to take over it. Hehe. I checked Google and it seems that with the exception of one site nobody is linking to it anymore.</p>
<p>A little more than a month ago there came the news about <a href="http://www.typepad.com" title="Great blogging service!">TypePad</a>. Whooo. Tried it out the moment I found about the launch of the public beta version. But for 9$ per month it wasn't the real deal for me. Since I'm a not-so-bad web developer I figured that even if I can't replicate the functionality of TypePad I can do something similar. So I cancelled my TypePad account on one of the last free days.</p>
<p>And so, here I am. For 10$ / year I bought <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net" title="Welcome :)">my own domain name</a>, which everybody hates, but hey it's my name... And for 5$ a month I got some <a href="http://www.totalchoicehosting.com/" title="Total Choice Hosting">great webhosting</a>. For the moment I'm busy customizing MT's templates for my needs. And then there will come the other sections of the site.</p>
<p>I'm quite excited and I'm eagerly looking forward for the moment when I can publicly launch my own personal site on the world wide web. Hehe.</p>
