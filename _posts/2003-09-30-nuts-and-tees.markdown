<p><img alt="My dirty left hand" src="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/my_dirty_hand.jpg" width="100" height="133" border="0" class="postimage" />That's my hand. I've been working in the garden, picking nuts today and yesterday and even if I constantly wore rubber gloves it shows badly. I don't really understand how because I tested the gloves with water and they aren't punctured. I have to live with it. At least until it washes off.<br />
I took a short trip today along with a friend to pick up the package I received from <a href="http://www.threadless.com" title="The coolest T-Shirt store on the web ;-)">Threadless.com</a> and we were very excited to open it and find some fantastic tees! I gave him his and came home to check out the remaining four (of which two are for <a href="http://www.softthunder.com">Mr. Designer</a>, one is for <a href="http://www.spinform.ro">Mr. Unofficial Partner</a> and one is for me). The t-shirts themselves are made by <a href="http://www.fruit.com">Fruit of the Loom</a> and the print is of the highest quality. I hope they will last long!</p>
