Here are some tidbits which I consider <i>news</i>:

<ul>
<li>When I got home yesterday found a letter on the table in which <a href="http://www.ipc.co.uk/">IPC Media</a> informed me that <a href="http://www.clubbing-uk.com/muzik_magazine_closed.htm">Muzik Magazine closed</a> and there'll be no further issues. This is sad. Very sad. I really enjoyed reading Muzik.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.napster.com">Napster</a> is about to relaunch as a pay-per-download service. I don't think it'll have the same success as the first version (no payed service will have as much success as a free one, ever!) although it's backed by an agressive advertising campaign.</li>
<li>Talking about Napster, there's Samsung's <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/009352.php" title="Samsung YP-910GS">Napster MP3 Player</a> which looks kinda cute and has lots of cool features! Maybe they'll import it to Romania too. In a year or two... At least.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> is about to lauch the 3rd version of their site. I'm keeping my eyes peeled because <acronym title="A List Apart">ALA</acronym> is one of those sites that preach for CSS based layouts and their articles are usually reference material.</li>
<li>I'm enjoying James Holden's <a href="http://www.stomp.com.au/eq/viewProduct.asp?intProductID=513311">Balance 005</a> mix more than a lot! It <i>balances</i> between quite a number of electronic music styles and sub-styles, while still managing to keep Holden's trademark sound signature. Great 2 CD set!</li>
<li>There's <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/big_fish/">a trailer available</a> for one of my favorite directors' new movie. I'm talking about Tim Burton's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319061/">Big Fish</a>. I'm really looking forward to see it as Burton always succeeds in creating hunting visual worlds...</li>
</ul>
That's about it for now.
