<p>Here comes <i>stuff</i>!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://retrospec.sgn.net/games/hoh/">Head Over Heels for Windows</a> - Windows remake of an old ZX Spectrum game I liked featuring some extra cool graphics!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/windowsxp_tips.asp">Windows XP Tips & Tricks</a></li>
<li><a href="http://color.twysted.net/">ColorMatch Remix</a> - Helps <i>color dumb</i> people like me pick a reasonably nice set of colors for a site.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.daltonlp.com/daltonlp.cgi?item_type=1&item_id=174">JavaScript Color Picker / Palette</a> - It's great for the config pages of web based content management systems or any other web application which needs to let users or administrators specify colors.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.emk.ro/leiras.jsp?bookID=181811">One of the Christmas gifts for my parents</a> - It's a compilation CD of some highly successful Hungarian songs from the 1960s which they love. The other present for them will be a coffee maker which I still have to pick (I'm strongly inclined towards a Philips).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.magazinultau.ro/product.php?product_id=2639">One of the Christmas gifts for my girlfriend</a> - I won't buy this from the web though! Among the other gifts will be a big pack of <a href="http://www.kinderbueno.de/" title="Yum!">Kinder Buenos</a> which she absolutely adores... And she practically asked for them. Haha.</li>
<li><a href="http://thekonst.net/">I like this dude</a> - Mostly for the great content on his site. I found him by searching <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a> for 'manele' which is an infamous kind of Romanian music but later I discovered that he spent some time really close to my hometown. Obviously I became really interested and checked most of the other stuff on the site which proved to be quite resourceful.</li>
