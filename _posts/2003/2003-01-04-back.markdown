Heyho...

I'm back. Actually I was back on the 1st but I was (and I still am) such in a bad mood that I really had absolutely no power to write in the blog. Actually I don't know why I have this bad mood, since the NYE party was quite, uhm, quite nice... I had the general bad mood since Christmas. And generally through the winter holidays because these are the days when you miss a girlfriend the most. And since I don't have one...

I leeched lots of nu skul / dark breaks lately. They're sooo cool. Hehe. Building up a nice library. As much as I can from dial-up... Yuk. Still better than nothing...
