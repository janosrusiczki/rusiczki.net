Missed the expected video trainspotting yesterday night. Missed everything in fact. Because I fell dead asleep. And of course that if I went to sleep at a "normal" hour (around 22:30) I'm up at this crazy hour (5:30). I just couldn't sleep anymore. That's bad. And there are periods when it's just like this. And I don't really understand why.

Anyway yesterday in the late afternoon / evening I finally had the chance to talk with my cousin. And we've talked. About this and that. Yek and yak. Lots of stuff. How's life in Spain was the main subject, but we brought up old memories too. It was really nice and I don't know why I didn't do it earlier. Why didn't I meet him, that is.

This morning I thought that since I couldn't sleep at least I should download some stuff (forgot to mention that <a href="http://www.slsk.org" title="The best P2P client for electronica heads!">SoulSeek</a> rules!). Wonder why they called me Mr. Downloader at that ex-firm... Hehe.
