Well yesterday was an interesting day. I woke up full of energy ready to work on those scripts. But the moment I opened my eyes I saw a thick layer of snow on the trees outside my window. I thought I should take a better look. I took a better look. And the moment I saw how things were looking outside, I decided:

Go boarding now or bust! So I ate quickly (checking the thermometer every 5 minutes to see that, yes, it's -4&deg;C constant) and went up to my Grandpa where I'm keeping my board / boots. Of course he wasn't home. I found him down in the town in front of the church helping to plow the snow, and he asked me to come back after about an hour. I came home. Plowed the snow myself. And then played some Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Just to get myself in the mood. :-) Anyway I haven't written a byte of code.

After an hour I was back at my Grandpa's. Got equipped (= I took my boots on) and I was off! Had a lot of fun, even if the track was kind of shit. Not enough snow, plus nobody mowed the place before the snow fell and this means that it didn't look so good, with all that grass / weed sticking out. Luckily snowboards slip on almost everything.

Conclusion: I had a lot of fun. I took my dose, so to say. But when I came home I fell flat into the bed. And slept since then. Now I'm up. It's 2 AM and something. My sleeping patterns are waaay beyond messed up.

The nice thing is that now that there's snow I have to work a lot on that project, plus, as a bonus, I have an exam Saturday. Oh, the joooys of exams. I don't think I'll have the chance to learn anything. But I'll try. Haha.

Great day!
