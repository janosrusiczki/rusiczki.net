I don't have the power to start learning economics now.

I spent all day writing code for three administration sections of an upcoming site. My brain is smoked out. Dead. I'm reading that stuff. But it's just as I would be looking at the empty, white, paper.

It's snowing heavily outside. So whatever happens tomorrow at the exam AND if the weather stays the same, I'll surely take another dose. This time I'm taking my camera with me. I just don't know how to pack it to ensure that I won't break it. Well. I'll see.
