Or should I say: just the usual? This time I haven't even been drunk. And still I made an idiotic move. Which makes me feel like shit now.

I had a good day yesterday. It had to end bad. Because otherwise it just wouldn't be me. My faith. My bad luck.

Now it's just the usual bad feeling. I'm beginning to feel weird when I'm not having it. Will bury myself into work as usual just to forget a bit about my misery.
