You can see so much stupidity on IRC. But sometimes you can see fun things too:

<blockquote><i>&lt;wu-nix&gt; 666 + 1337 = 2003 :) evil l33t year</i></p></blockquote>
Also saw <a href="http://www2.photosig.com/viewphoto.php?id=481822" title="A wonderful photo of a butterly.">this link</a> on IRC. It should only smile and it would be the perfect portrait.
