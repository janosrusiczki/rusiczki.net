I just finished watching <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0167404" title="IMDB Link">this movie</a>. And all I can say is: wow! It's a long time since I saw a movie that gave me the shrieks at the end and this one surely did. Such an fantastic twist. And I should also mention that Haley Joel Osment was great. He's a very talented kid.

There's also an interesting story behind me seeing this movie... Because I saw about half of it at Web Web Studio. The first and the last company (up until now at least) where I worked. And it's more than one year since then.

Now I'm getting ready to watch 'The Whole Nine Yards'. Another Bruce Willis movie. Hehe. OK. I'm hurrying to post this actually because it's already on!
