At a given moment my webspace got filled up and since then I was having problems with my blog. I could use this as an excuse for not posting anything...

But this seems solved. As I migrated Movable Type's data storage to MySQL. It's much easier for me to back it up this way too as I have much more experience with MySQL than with Berkeley DB... Actually I still have no ideea what the latter is except that is somekind of file based database. The only small problemo is that PERL works really slowly with MySQL. And <b>eats</b> CPU power like mad.

I only lost 2 entries. And these were links. One of them at least I know for sure was a link to Cutie Quake...

<b>UPDATE:</b> I'm really pleased to see that the comments were exported / imported too! Wheeew! Nice!
