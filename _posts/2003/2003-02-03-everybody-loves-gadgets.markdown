I'm about to receive the much avaited HotSync cable for my Palm. So the fun can begin. I hope not to get in such an <a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article.jhtml?articleID=481193" title="The full article">embarassing situation</a> as this guy did:

<blockquote><i>A member of Norway's Parliament was caught playing a war game on his hand-held computer, right during the middle of Wednesday's parliamentary debate on Iraq. The red-faced representative from the Conservative Party has since apologized.</i></p></blockquote>
I'm really looking forward for some Solitaire on the bus on my way to school. I've been missing Solitaire since the moment I sold my Ericsson T28. My new Nokia has such lame games! I don't find Snake as addictive as many do. As a matter of fact I don't really find it amusing or entertaining either.

I've been also looking at some reviews about the <a href="http://www.aibo.com/" title="Yes, it's the Sony AIBO">&uuml;ber gadget</a> tonight. But until I'll save 1500$ for a <i>toy</i> there's Leila, my cocker. Who's pregnant again! Damn. :-)
