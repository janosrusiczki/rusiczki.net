Yes. Today I slept all day since I stood awake until about 8 o'clock in the morning... The phone drove me crazy since it rang a lot. But one of the calls was a guy from the customs asking me for my address... I don't know how can they lose your address but not your phone number, but I answered him calmly. He said that they will send the package by Fan Curier (a Romanian quick delivery service). But he was talking so calmly I forgot to ask why he said 'we will' and not 'we are' sending your package... Perhaps because I waited such a short time?

OK. So it seems that tomorrow I'll have the package. At least I hope so.
