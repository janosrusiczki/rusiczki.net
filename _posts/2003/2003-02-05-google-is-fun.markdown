And I'm a geek!

Anyway. Searching for your name is always fun. Even more fun if you have an uncommon name.

<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rusiczki">Results on the Web</a>

From these you can see that I own and maintain <a href="http://www.resurseweb.net/">this site</a>, that I have a long un-updated <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rusiczkij/" title="My Geocities page right from 1998...">personal page</a>, I also designed <a href="http://www.ubm.ro/ubm/" title="ubm.ro">my other university's page</a> (and put it on PHP later), I <a href="http://gimli.externet.hu/pipermail/wl-phplista/2000-December/date.html" title="The December 2000 archives">participated</a> in the hungarian PHP list, and that I made a first Romanian translation for <a href="http://www.phpbb.com" title="The BEST free bulletin board system!">phpBB</a>. Also some other smaller things... Fading away...

<a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=rusiczki">Results in Google Image Search</a>

I like this one the most. It yields on result. And it's a picture of me. In person. Last summer. In my favourite bar. Though the picture doesn't show somebody on my left side... That somebody who made me so happy that day.

<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=rusiczki">Results in Usenet Groups Search</a>

The first result is not so relevant... But those other names sound familiar. Anyway it seems I'm deep rooted. :-) Then again there is proof that I work with and like PHP / MySQL.

<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rusiczki&sa=N&tab=gd&cat=gwd%2FTop">Results in DMOZ Directory Search</a>

Again. I'm the owner of <a href="http://www.resurseweb.net/">resurseweb.net</a> and I designed <a href="http://www.ubm.ro/ubm/">ubm.ro</a>.

Luckily (or not) I'm not present in the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=rusiczki">news</a>...

<b>BONUS</b>

Searching for one <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22bogdan+rosu%22">friend's name</a> showed that he was a really active amateur electronic musician back in 2000 when he hit the USENET for a short period. :-)
