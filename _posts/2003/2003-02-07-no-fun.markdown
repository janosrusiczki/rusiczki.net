I'm sick. My neck hurts. I hate to be sick.

I'm not yet in the 'down to bed' position even if I should stay in bed for the medication I took to be effective. But I just can't. I lay there 'til 4PM anyway... So now I'm staying in front of my 'puter bloggin' some eating some yummy cookies. I took this 'bad on stomach' tablets and they're bad on my stomach. Really powerful antibiotics. So I need to eat constantly or else my tummy will begin to ache.

It's bad to be sick...
