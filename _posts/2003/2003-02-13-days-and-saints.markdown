Yeah... It's almost <a href="http://www.shagtown.com/days/valentine.html" title="Bleaaah!">Valentine's Day</a>. And I'm just guessing what my girl collegues will come up with today... About boyfriends and this upcoming day.

Actually I kinda hate it. And not solely because almost as long as I can remember I was alone on this day like on any other. But because this is just another <b>Import Day</b>...
