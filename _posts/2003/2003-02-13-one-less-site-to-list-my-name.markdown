It was with great sadness that I read an announcement on <a href="http://www.baiamare.net" title="It went offline... :-(">baiamare.net</a> saying that it won't be updated anymore. It's sad that it closes since it was the leading "portal" site for Baia Mare and one of the best in the country.

I remember the times (back in the summer of 2001) when there was this huge "fight" between me and the guy who was behind that site. And this fight only made me more ambitious to make the long defunct <a href="http://www.baiamarecity.com" title="Only available on my hard drive...">baiamarecity.com</a> better. And this way I learned a lot of stuff. After going online with baiamarecity.com I saw what it meant to keep a news site in a town where people had really no ideea what a portal site for a town meant... No news contributions, no nothing. It seems that he closed his site for the same reasons... Sad.

I just hope he'll have better luck with his webdesign company.
