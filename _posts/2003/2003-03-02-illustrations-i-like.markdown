I really like these "made in 50's" kind of illustrations as found on the <a href="http://www.losthighways.org/radebaugh.html">Radebaugh page</a>. We have a lot of almanacs of various technology related magazines full of printed pics like this up in our garret as my father was obsessed with technology right about that time (the sixties and seventies to be exact). I should organize an expedition... To dig up some cool old stuff worth scanning. Then get a scanner... I'm getting sleepy only thinking about it. Lazy me.
