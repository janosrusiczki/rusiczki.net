Now <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/03/01/shure_e5c_im_in_sound_heaven.html">Shure E5C</a> and <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/01/30/shure_e2c_the_best_headphones_ive_ever_used.html">Shure E2C</a> are surely the best headphones I ever read about. But why does the first one cost 5 times as much as the second. And why-oh-why does this mean 500$? Definetly not for the poor. :-)
