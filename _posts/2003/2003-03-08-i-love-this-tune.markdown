> Got answers for everyone, endless excuses  
Not habit for anyone, cos I'm trying to break your click-track heart  
Seen a vision of perfect grace, airbrushed and lifeless  
All contempt and aftertaste it's like I'm waiting for the scars to heal  

Sneaker Pimps - Loretta Young Silks

**Update on the 22nd of January, 2024** I totally forgot about this post probably right after writing it, and had no idea it existed until today, 21 years later when I was browsing the music category on my blog. I certainly had no idea about its existence 5 years later, [when I registered clicktrackheart.com](https://www.rusiczki.net/2008/03/12/free-email-for-all-sneaker-pimps-fans/). In that post I'm wondering how did the song pop into my head...
