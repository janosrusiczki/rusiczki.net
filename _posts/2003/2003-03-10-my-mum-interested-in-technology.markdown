Tonight my mother was in my room to do some work. Because she said she couldn't concentrate out in the kitchen where father was watching Big Brother... Anyway. I helped her to calculate some calories (as she's a nurse at a kindergarten). And instead of the usual calculator I've used the Palm to do the arithmetics. And then she used the Palm to do the arithmetics. I was quite amazed that she put her hands on a piece of modern technology. Because she's usually very afraid of such things.

And even more weird. After we finished she took it and started pushing it's buttons looking all amazed and telling me that: "Wow, look how advanced technology is nowadays, and I still have to calculate these damn calories!"

There's something wrong. Something definetly wrong here!
