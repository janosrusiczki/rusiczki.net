Mickey Mouse was great!

It's so sad that there's nothing on [Daypop.com](http://www.daypop.com) about the Oscars. It seems that the whole weblog community is concentrating on the war. Fortunately a [search](http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=oscar&btnG=Search) on [Feedster](http://www.feedster.com) doesn't show such sad results...

Best supporting actress, two nominations from Chicago, and... One of them wins, of course. It's [Catherine Zeta-Jones](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Zeta-Jones%2C+Catherine). Who's pregnant... Wow!

Haha. Alias Wavefront's Maya... An achievement indeed...

Frida's music sounds great! (The score I mean.) And Salma "I started as an actress in a soap opera" Hayek looks great!

Sound. I put my tip on Lord of The Rings. Chicago... Whooops.

Sound editing. OK. My tip is again on Lord Of The Rings. Bingo this time! :-)

First anti-war speech.
