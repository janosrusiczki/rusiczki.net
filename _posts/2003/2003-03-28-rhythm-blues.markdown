<blockquote><i>Mary's got the same size hands

As Marilyn Monroe

She put her fingers in the imprints

At Manns Chinese Theater Show

She coulda been a movie star

Never got the chance to go that far

Her life was stole

Now we'll never know</i></p></blockquote>
<i>Kelly Rowland - Stole</i>

It's funny that I like some R&B songs so much while I hate much of the rest of the genre...
