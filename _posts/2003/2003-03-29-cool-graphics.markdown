My friend <a href="http://www.lucianmarin.ro/" title="His portofolio">Lucian Marin</a> (aka bflux) put <strike><a href="http://www.resurseweb.net/~bfx/nomarker/" title="The original gallery.">some graphics of his</a></strike> online. As much as I get it these were made with a marker. What I don't know is if these were private stuff or not. But they were so cool, I mean SO COOL, I just had to make <strike><a href="http://www.resurseweb.net/mt/gallery/nomarker" title="Ubercool graphics!!!">a copy</a></strike> for "eternity". Because with Luci you never know when he deletes stuff. And it's a pitty to delete such cool stuff.

I really enjoyed these pics. I really think some of them are awesome!!!

Congrats pal! Warm handshakes and everything!
