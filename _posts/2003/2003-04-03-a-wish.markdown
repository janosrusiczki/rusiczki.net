Oh, how I wish I would have PHP on my Palm. But then again. If I think about it...

What's given: The 8 Megs of RAM of the Palm m500.

Which are the requirements: Squeeze a web server, MySQL, PHP and a browser into <b>that</b>. It might not be impossible. But a laptop is a much more straightforward solution.

Time for another, more realistic, wish... :-)
