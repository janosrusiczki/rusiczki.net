Right now I'm downloading <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" title="The B.E.S.T. Browser!">Mozilla 1.3</a> and I should soon get and install <a href="http://www.mysql.org">MySQL 4.0</a> and <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP 4.3.2</a> (which were recently declared stable) and I should try <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache 2</a> which was released more than a year ago as far as I know but I'm still not sure if I'll manage installing / configuring it. But that were the thoughts I had 2 years ago about Apache 1.3... And then came my graduation project. That's when I learned the most about Apache's <i>httpd.conf</i>.
