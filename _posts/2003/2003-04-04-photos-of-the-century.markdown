Sometimes you just have to be lucky. Take <a href="http://wire.ap.org/APpackages/centuryphotos/photo132.html" title="A deer is struck by a car">this shot</a> as an example.

Taken from <a href="http://wire.ap.org/APpackages/centuryphotos/photoframes.html">Photos of the Century</a> by Associated Press. This showcase is full of really impressive photos!
