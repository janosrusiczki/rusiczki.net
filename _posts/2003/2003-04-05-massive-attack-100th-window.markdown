After so much frustration let's talk about the music!

But I don't know what to say about this album. Because so much has been said... Countless sites published reviews. There are lots of them in magazines, forums, shopping sites... I'm not adding one to the long list.

All I can say is that I'm on the side of those who enjoy the album. A lot. It's fantastic. Of course that after you release something so big as Mezzanine it's hard to top it. And I can't say that <i>100th Window</i> is better than <i>Mezzanine</i>. But it's not worse either. I love the album and that's that! :-)
