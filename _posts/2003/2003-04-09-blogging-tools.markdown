Two of the Windows tools I use related to my "blogging experience", ehem, are <a href="http://www.wbloggar.com">w.bloggar</a>, which I'm using to write these lines and almost all the other lines in my blog, and <a href="http://yole.ru/projects/syndirella/">Syndirella</a> which I use to read almost all of the blogs I use to read. Almost all because I only use Syndirellea to read those blogs which offer full post RSS syndication.

The bad news is that Syndirella's author <a href="http://home.yole.ru/weblog/archives/000091.html"> posted in his blog</a> that he'll abandon working on this great blog and newsreader tool. Which is sad. Because I really enjoy using that piece of software. Oh well, I hope somebody else will pick up the project since it's opensource. And I'll give a try to <a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/04/06.html#000056">SharpReader</a> too.
