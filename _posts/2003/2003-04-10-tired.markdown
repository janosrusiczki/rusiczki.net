I wanted to post a long entry about what happened yesterday and today (pretty busy days) but I'm so tired that my head hurts. And my head hurts 3 or 4 times a year. And when it does hurt it means that I've crossed the line. 4 and 6 hours of sleeping / night is not much.... Not enough.

Bed time again.
