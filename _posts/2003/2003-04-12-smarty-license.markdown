Well, after driving a certain somebody crazy with Lesser GPL I found <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=smarty-general&m=101768160816744&w=2">all the informations</a> I needed about <a href="http://smarty.php.net" title="Maybe the best template engine for PHP">Smarty's</a> license by simply searching it's mailing list archive for 'license'.

Well, sorry. :-P

And since I was there I got the latest Smarty, which is 2.5.0.
