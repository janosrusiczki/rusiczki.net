Well, I'm planning to turbo up my PC a little since I last upgraded my processor and mainboard back in the spring of 2001. I plan to get an AMD 2.2+ processor with the matching mainboard (I think I will choose the Epox 8RDA+) and "lots" of memory meaning 512 MB of RAM. I'm curious how long will this configuration stand... I'm amazed about the fact that what I have now still works OK. I can't say my computer is zippy. Especially not with Windows XP. But it works well. And I can't really complain much... Except when talking about games.

Well. Time to put away some money for the upgrade. Find buyers for the old wares. And the rest of the procedures associated with an upgrade process.
