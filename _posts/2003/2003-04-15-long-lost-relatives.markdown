<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0966449606/104-6725439-2840711">This book</a> is quite interesting. And not because of it's content. But because of the last names of the authors... Are they long lost relatives? If so, what are they doing describing Scottland? As far as I know my roots are somewhere in Poland. Hmmm.

Found the book by searching Amazon for my name using the new search box powered by Google. So the first signs of Amazon's contract with Google are beginning to show.
