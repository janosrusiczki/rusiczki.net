Tonight was one of those rare nights when <a href="http://www.triggerfinger.ro/lmarin/">Luci</a> gave me links that I actually liked. :-)

<a href="http://www.stevescott.com.au">Steve Scott</a> has some incredible illustrations. And <a href="http://juniatwork.mrtio.com/">Giulia Balladore</a> rocks with her passion for those small details.

I dropped my camera (dropping stuff is not me - not at all), I'm enjoying vector based graphics... What's next? The end of the world? :-)
