I'm back. Phew! What a weekend last weekend was!

I spent most of the second half of the week preparing my birthday. I wanted it to be a real blast. Which it was. Well, mostly. I bought the booze as early as Friday. And then Saturday I spent 3 hours buying 2 tortillas, 3 pizzas and 4 litres of Pepsi plus one litre of apple juice. Came home. Spent two hours reorganizing my room. Then I put myself into 'wait mode'. For my guests. Who showed up. Some gave me cute presents. But most gave me alcohol. What the Hell? Hmmm. We ate. Sat. Listened to music. Drank some. And then we were off. To celebrate. Hehe.

The usual club. I was lucky. I was able to select and play the music I wanted. And as usual (hehe) after I looked out about five tunes later I started using the computer I saw a dancefloor full of people dancing. I don't know. I guess I'm a good DJ after all. :-)

This went on for a while. Good tunes coming and going. People dancing. Then some girls came asking if I can put on some harder drum'n'bass and I gave way to one of my friends who's an expert in this field. People continued to dance. Fun was on. But I lost track. Too much vodka I guess. Anyway. At about 4 AM we took a taxi. And I was home safely at about 4:40. To celebrate Easter. And to clean up my room. Called a few friends. Had a nice morning chat. And then this week started... All of the sudden.
