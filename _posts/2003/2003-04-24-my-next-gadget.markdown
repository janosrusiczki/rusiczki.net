Even I myself can't stop myself.

I intend to get myself a GameBoy Advance SP. No more boring bus rides. And a <a href="http://www.gamegizmo.com/products.php?sysID=5&catID=13&pID=15">Flash Advance Linker</a> of course... Because I do not intend to pay 30 Euros or more for a game which might as well turn out to be pure trash. And since I have 200 Megs of game ROMs on my hard drive I think this will be a profitable move...

I'm just afraid to count how much all this fun will cost me... But maybe I'll drop the idea... It depends on how I will manage financially during the next months.
