Well, starting again. For the 3rd or 4th time I guess...

I hope this will go well.

<a href="http://www.typepad.com">Typepad</a> looks really cool and has an impressive array of features at a first glance. I will some things soon (like I'll try to import my older posts)... See what happens. If after the trial I still like it I think I'm going to keep it.

<b>UPDATE</b>

Actually it didn't work out so well. Since for less than the price of TypePad's Plus service I get this <a href="http://www.totalchoicehosting.com" title="Total Choice Hosting">nice hosting</a>. And for 10 bucks more I got my own domain name too. <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2003/09/21/restarting-again/">Read more about it.</a>
