Oh joy! I succeded importing all my entries from my last MT weblog which sat on resurseweb.net, a domain that expired in the meantime, and I had no control to renew it. And it wasn't a big fuss either. Just grabbed the MySQL backup again and I made a little PHP script to show all the entries as TypePad's import feature needed them. And it went smooth.

The comments were not imported. And I still have to transfer all the images.
