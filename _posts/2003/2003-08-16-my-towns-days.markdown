Yes. It's that time of the year. When all gather to celebrate Baia Sprie's days. My opinion? It's a huge gathering of idiots and mostly gypsies. I guess tonight will be cute anyway I because there'll be fireworks and I always liked them. But as it looks now I think I won't attend. I will go out and snap some pics later this afternoon though.

Yesterday I took some pictures too. For the local paper of course. I snapped the crowd around the catholic church with some stands selling forgettable memorabilia, some pics inside the church during the festive mass and then after a break I went to where I liked it the most, somekind of a local art gallery which was setup especially for the occasion. This meant that local artists and associations exposed their works. Mostly nice and even very nice stuff except the kiddish works of the local *>Women's Association* which made me think that they were done mostly for the sake of being done ('Girls, we MUST present something!'). They were cute at a level, but they had absolutely no artistical meaning whatsoever.

I should work on [GSM Boutique](http://www.gsmboutique.com). I'm expecting a footer from the designer I'm working with [Mr. Adapt](http://www.spinform.ro) and then I can re-start full speed work.

The restoring process is not working so well since I don't know where I saved those Movable Type database backups. Will save them again. Then install MT locally (this means Perl too). Then export the entries. Then import them into Typepad. Yeah. I love computers. Not.

After sending out a mail to a nice guy I received the vectorial file with design for a very cool t-shirt. Time to call a friend's father and enquire about the possibilities of actually putting this on fabric. I will love this t-shirt!

**Update on January 7, 2021, more than 17 years later** I just checked and it seems that I was actually listening to *Princess Superstar - Do it like a robot (Hell Rocks The Equalizer Remix)*. The remix part is very important because when I started listening to the original song I realized I haven't ever heard it. The remix though, I recognized instantly.
