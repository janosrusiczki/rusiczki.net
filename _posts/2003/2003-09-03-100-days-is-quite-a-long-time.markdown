And all this time my CPU was in the service of humanity. Haha. In fact 70% of this time was made at my ex - workplace where the <a href="http://www.grid.org">UD Agent</a> was running night and day - seven days a week.

Nowadays, I'm mainly running it because of the free gigs they give you for running it over at <a href="http://www.easynews.com">EasyNews</a>. But it's also good to know that you're doing something good. Rather than searching for ET over at the <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@HOME</a> project...

I had to had, of course, the paranoid ideea that maybe it's not the cure for cancer or smallpox that my good ol' AMD XP1800+ is researching but some new biological weapons for the US... Heh. I guess one can never know for sure. But still I'm 95% positive that it's doing what they say it's doing. Which is a very good thing.

I can only hope that someday a cure will be found and it'll be good to know that in some way or another I helped.
