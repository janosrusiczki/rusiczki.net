And all this time my CPU was in the service of humanity. Haha. In fact 70% of this time was made at my ex - workplace where the [UD Agent](http://www.grid.org) was running night and day - seven days a week.

Nowadays, I'm mainly running it because of the free gigs they give you for running it over at [EasyNews](http://www.easynews.com). But it's also good to know that you're doing something good. Rather than searching for ET over at the [SETI@HOME](http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/) project...

I had to have, of course, the paranoid ideea that maybe it's not the cure for cancer or smallpox that my good ol' AMD XP1800+ is researching but some new biological weapons for the US... Heh. I guess one can never know for sure. But still I'm 95% positive that it's doing what they say it's doing. Which is a very good thing.

I can only hope that someday a cure will be found and it'll be good to know that in some way or another I helped.

**Update on the 7th of May, 2024** (that's 20 years and 8 months later): It seems I was incorrect about the processor type, I actually had an AMD Athlon XP 2000+, confirmed by finding both the papers about buying it as well as the processor itself in the attic.
