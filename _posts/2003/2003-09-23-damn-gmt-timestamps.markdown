I'm working on a project. And my ambition was to store all timestamps in the database as GMT timestamps for maximum flexibility.

Conclusion? I cut the branch under my own feet. And I'm saying this because since 6 hours I've been struggling with these things and I made absolutely no advances! My mind strangely locks up. Too many variables. Too little experience. GMT. Plus 2 hours. Minus 5 hours. Offset of the server. Offset of the user. ARRRGH! I think I'll start biting the corners of the furniture in my room!

For the moment I have no ideea how to continue... Google didn't come up with anything relevant. Maybe (I hope!) it'll come to me tomorrow morning.
