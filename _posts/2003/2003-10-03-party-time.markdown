It seems that fun comes in waves. At least this is what's happening to me nowadays. I mean for a few months nothing important happens and then suddenly there comes the <b>party season</b>!

Last weekend DuBase, one of Romania's finest breakbeat DJs, visited Baia Mare. Next weekend it's the <a href="http://www.tmbase.ro/">TMBase festival</a> which is the biggest and most important Romanian electronic music festival. Held yearly at Timisoara. And then in a week it's <a href="http://www.freeland.fm">Adam Freeland</a> in Bucharest. I'll attend these. Unfortunately I will not attend Hyper who comes in a week after Freeland. The reasons are obvious: I don't have a money factory in my basement. Unfortunately.

Whoo! Tough times ahead! Also huge money spilling ahead. Looks like having fun is rather expensive. Anyway after this I think there won't be anything important until Christmas. At least not this big or important.
