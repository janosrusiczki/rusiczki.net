It's a really cool one. I haven't seen many good music videos lately. In fact I haven't seen any memorable music videos lately. But I'm not watching music tv channels so much anymore. And if I am, I most probably tune in to VH1 which usually broadcasts music which matches my taste at least as long as it comes to music broadcasted by music tv channels.

Lately I listened a lot to the minidiscs I recorded with <a href="http://drumandbass.ro/dnb/artists/dj_dubase/" title="DuBase's profile @ DrumAndBass.RO">DuBase's</a> performance last weekend and I dug up an older mixed CD I got from <a href="http://drumandbass.ro/dnb/artists/infamous_massive/" title="Seb's profile at DrumAndBass.RO">Seb</a> which slowly grew on me to the point that I like it a lot now and listen to it almost every day. At least parts of it depending on my time. Great job pal! :)

<b>UPDATE</b> The download link is gone since it was generating way to much traffic over at <a href="http://www.drumandbass.ro">drumandbass.ro</a> and the guys who host the site for free started complaining... Sorry.
