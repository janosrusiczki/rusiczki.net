I was thinking about buying the SP version of course because it's cooler and everything, but I always postponed the purchase because another things popped into the image and it looked quite expensive. But when you get a deal at hand for only 30 &euro; the console and an additional 15 &euro; for the game cartridge you can't really refuse. So now I have a <acronym title="GameBoy Advance">GBA</acronym> plus <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/gba/sports/tonyhawksproskater2/index.html">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</a> which looks like one of the best games ever made for this cool console.

All is set for some serious thumb abuse!
