I found a funny phrase on the <a title="mIRC Online Registration" href="https://www.regsoft.net/regsoft/order.php3?productid=36841">mIRC online registration page</a>. It says:

<blockquote>mIRC costs US$20.00. You can, however, choose a different amount below based on what you can afford, if you wish.</p></blockquote>
And it lets you choose between $10, $20, $30 and $40. Now which price would you choose?
