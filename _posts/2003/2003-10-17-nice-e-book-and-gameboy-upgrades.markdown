Chuck Palahniuk's <a title="Palm Digital Media: Lullaby" href="http://www.palmdigitalmedia.com/book.cgi/0385504497">Lullaby</a> looks like my next read. I've neglegted my Palm lately and I feel guilty.

However the <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2003/10/08/advance-deal/">GameBoy I bought</a> recently will get an upgrade soon because I've just passed an order for a <a href="http://www.linkerworld.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/36">linker</a>, which will allow me to play those ROMs I've got sitting around on my hard drive since quite some time. And also, maybe, if time will allow it, develop my own stuff for the <acronym title="GameBoy Advance">GBA</acronym>. I remember that when I had the GameBoy fever back in the time when I was <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2003/04/24/my-next-gadget/">thinking for the first time</a> about buying one, I made a small .gba file which did nothing but showed a pic of my town on the screen. I had a nice collection of <acronym title="GameBoy Advance">GBA</acronym> developer site links back then which I eventually lost. But I'll surely get around it, if it hits me again.
