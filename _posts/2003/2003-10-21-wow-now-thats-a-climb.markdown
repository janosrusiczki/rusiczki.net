Yey! I <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rusiczki">searched for my last name</a> with Google about a week ago and this blog came in on the last page. I don't remember exactly but I think it wasn't the last result but the one before the last. Anyway, re-checking now I saw that it hopped up to the fourth place on the first page. I read in some blog a while ago that Google just loves blogs. How true! I bet it'll soon be number one... One or two more comments in <a href="http://www.unix-girl.com/blog/">Kasia's blog</a>...
