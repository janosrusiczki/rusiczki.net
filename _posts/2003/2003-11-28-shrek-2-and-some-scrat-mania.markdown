<img alt="scrat-small.gif" src="https://content.rusiczki.net/blogpics/scrat-small.gif" width="150" height="108" border="0" class="postimage"/>Oh my God! It looks everyone's favorite ogre <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/shrek_2/" title="A really green trailer!">is about to return</a>! I can barely wait since the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126029/" title="Shrek">original movie</a> was hands down <b>the best</b> computer generated cartoon I ever saw. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268380/">Ice Age</a> is close or maybe better visually but it surely can't reach Shrek's killer dialogue. And of what I see on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/" title="The Internet Movie Database">IMDB</a>, Eddie Murphy will be Donkey again in part 2 so we're looking ahead for some serious verbal fun! May 21st, 2004, come quick!

Oh, and can I have a wish? I want more of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0342965/" title="Scrat in gone nutty">Scrat</a> (I'm talking about the little creature pictured here on the left). More more more more more more!
