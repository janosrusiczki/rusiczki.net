So, <a href="http://www.magazinultau.ro/product.php?product_id=2639" title="Philips Satinelle Epilator">the gift</a> for my girlfriend is a 'check'. And NO, this present doesn't have any hidden message attached to it, she said she would like one and I got the message and bought one. Anyway checking out the product I can say without a doubt that women <i>are</i> crazy. I would never touch my skin with THAT! When it's turned on it makes a horrific noise and the way those rotating discs look... Yay! Out of a movie! Really scary!

I have nothing for my parents yet. It's too late to order <a href="http://www.emk.ro/leiras.jsp?bookID=181811">that CD</a>, and the coffee maker doesn't seem to worth it. Or at least so I was told. Hmmm. I have to come up with something appropriate pretty quick. Because days are going by really fast and the big C is looming.

I can barely wait however.
