As I <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2003/10/21/winamp-5-rocks/">already mentioned</a> I really love Winamp 5. I loved it in it's beta phase, I downloaded two release candidates and it looks like <a title="Winamp 5 download" href="http://www.winamp.com/player/">the final version 5</a> is out. The new skins are pretty slick too. So I'm getting a few of them.

I hope that it works now with <a href="http://guerillasoft.nstemp.com/mp3cue/" title="THE plug-in of choice if you have ripped mixes lying around">mp3cue</a>. Because the first beta I got didn't and so I uninstalled mp3cue back then and I was lazy to put it back since then. Well, I'll have to try.

Oh, and the <a href="http://www.winamp.com">Winamp site</a> got a new design.
