I wish to all who read this message the warmest and merriest Christmas of them all. Have a nice Holiday Season friends...

**UPDATE:** Oh yeah, one of my favorite Christmas songs is The Pogues's [Fairytale Of New York](https://content.rusiczki.net/blogstuff/The_Pogues_and_Kirsty_MacColl-Fairytale_of_New_York.mp3 "Ehem...") performed with Kirsty MacColl (who unfortunately passed away in December 2000, RIP)... Alongside Dream Theather's *Falling Into Infinity* album and a bunch of others I can't remember now. Let me finish by quoting part of the Pogues song's [lyrics](https://www.kirstymaccoll.com/songs/other-peoples-songs/fairytale-of-new-york/ "Full Lyrics"):

> You scum bag  
You maggot  
You cheap lousy faggot  
Happy Christmas your arse  
I pray God  
It's our last

Yep, it's a little raw! But still, Merry Christmas everyone!
