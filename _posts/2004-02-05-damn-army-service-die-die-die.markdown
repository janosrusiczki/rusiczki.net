<p>Yesterday and today were some days to remember!</p>
<p>I've been expecting two packages with two gadgets yesterday and so I woke up at 10 AM (a personal record for me, really) and rushed out to the gate to check the mailboxes in a bath gown I took over my pijamas. I was wearing a cap on my head because it was rather cold in my room and besides it was raining outside. If somebody saw me... There was nothing in any of the mailboxes so I retreated to my room and went back to bed. I layed on my back for some time then got up and fiddled with my computer for a while until it was time for another mailbox check. Rushed out again (same costume) and now there was stuff in one of the mailboxes. In fact it was too much stuff...</p>
<p>First of all there was the announcement that the PlayStation2 I've been expecting arrived and I should go and pick it up. Then, there was a package addressed to someone else with the same last name as mine (mistake of the postman). And finally there was a small paper which meant bad news. Very bad news. The one piece of paper each and every young man in Romania is afraid of. "Ordin de incorporare" was written on it. This means that they're calling you to do the mandatory army service (one full year if you do not have any superior studies, half a year if you have). Yeyks!!! Anyway, if you're studying the moment you get the paper they're not taking you but I got scared badly anyway since last year there was a huge scandal which resulted in my (and other's) nerves being stretched to the max for two days. And this happened only because some fucker there at the unit didn't want to accept our papers because he didn't felt like accepting them that day... I'm getting nervous just talking about this. Typical stupidity. The point is: I got scared.</p>
<p>I went down to the post office and picked up my PS2 (more about this in a later post). After my parents got home I told them what happened and I said I'll take a short trip to my university to get the necessary paper that confirms that I'm a student. I went down. Got the paper. Came home. Played my brain off. At least it was comforting to forget a little about it. I couldn't get my new camera (the other gadget I was expecting) yesterday night (more about this in yet another later post).</p>
<p>And so, somehow, there came today's morning when I woke up early and went down to the military unit one day earlier than expected, grinding my teeth with fear and expecting the worst. And I went in, the guy at the door told me a number for an office, went there, handed the papers to a lady, she said OK, and that was it! That was all! Well, after getting out of there I nearly screamed of happiness. I think I had a rather huge smile on my face.</p>
<p>I hope they won't bother me again with this SHIT. At least not this year.</p>
