<p>Unfortunately there was no snowboarding action today as <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2004/02/21/snowboarding_trip" title="Kitsched - Snowboarding trip">I expected</a> yesterday. I found out about this late yesterday night, when the guy I was going with said he's got something else to do today, so I decided that instead of resting I'll join my girlfriend and visit an event called "Boarder's Party" in Baia Mare's main club. It turned out to be an OK party with good music and nice people. In spite of sitting most of the time, because all my muscles and bones and whatever else is inside me hurt badly (12 rounds is well over my usual threshold), I met lots of friends there and found out that the follow-up to <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2003/03/14/finally_an_active_day_ahead" title="Kitsched - Finally, an active day ahead">last year's big air competition</a> will be held on the 13th of March. Wooo! Wooo! Can't wait for it! Time to snap some fine pics.</p>
