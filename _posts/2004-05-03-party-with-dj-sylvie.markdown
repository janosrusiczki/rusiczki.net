After <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2004/05/03/the_official_may_1st_food_fest" title="Kitsched - The official May 1st food fest!">all that eating</a> it was time for a real party! With some real people. And a real DJ. Or DJess. As you wish.

<a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/dj_sylvie.php" onclick="window.open('http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/dj_sylvie.php','popup','width=1024,height=768,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/dj_sylvie-thumb.jpg" width="120" height="90" border="0" alt="DJ Sylvie doing her thing" class="postimage" /></a> I know I'll say a cliche but she lifted us high and kept us there for a while. Too bad every party has to end because sometimes you wish for the opposite so badly... But at least my party portofolio includes another nice experience. And when I think about the fact that I hardly wanted to go because I was tired of all that eating, mountain climbing and descending... But thanks to a certain girl's convincing power I went. And I don't regret the decision for a second because I had a such greeeat time and from the moment I arrived in the disco I felt no sign of tiredness only euphoria and party hunger. :-) A perfect way to end a perfect day. Yay!

Here's <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogstuff/sylvie.avi" title="1 MB - DivX 3.1">a short video clip</a> with one of the glory moments. I watched it at least 20 times and every time it gave me the goosebumps. So nice...
