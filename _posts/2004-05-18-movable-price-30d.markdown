<p>While almost all the weblogging community is <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/its_about_time.shtml">bragging about it</a>, in all this rush with the new appartment and everything I just took <a href="http://www.movabletype.org" title="Movable Type 3.0D">it</a> and installed it. It went through without any problems and it works OK as I came to expect from a <a href="http://www.sixapart.com" title="Six Apart">6A</a> product but the added features are a little too few to justify the new pricing schemes... Just my $0.02. I only have one weblog (this) so the licensing is not really a big problem for me. And I'm sure I won't switch to other publishing systems soon... I'm just not in the mood and I really have no time for any <a href="http://blog.carthik.net/vault/2004/05/14/movabletype-to-wordpress/" title="Moving from Movable Type to WordPress @ Carthik.net">upgrades</a> now.</p>
