<p>Since yesterday morning my <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2004/06/01/cabled_headaches">cable Internet related headaches</a> ended. Because I went to the cable company to pick up my contract which was there to be rectified because they messed up my name at first try (nothing unusual there) and I also asked for my subscription to be changed to 64 kbps with unlimited included traffic per month. So as of yesterday I'm back in my posture of a hard downloader pimp! Weee! I also played a few stages of Colin McRae Rally as <a href="http://www.timbru.com">Gabriel</a> suggested in a previous comment, and it's indeed really fun.<br />
I just posted this quickly in an advertising break of the Romanian Playboy Awards live on Pro TV. On a Saturday night when I'm staying in. Unusual...</p>
