After <a href="http://www.timbru.com/">Gabriel</a> posted <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1139359724757783/" title="Make digital movies the easy way">a link</a> to <a href="http://www.engadget.com">Engadget's</a> how-to guide on how to make nice home movies on your PC using nothing but your miniDV camera and Microsoft Movie Maker, I'm posting the link to this week's bonus how-to on Engadget: '<a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/8828351836181248/">Turn your PC into a Mac</a>'.

OK, it's undoubtedly nice, but as we all know these kinds of customizations run well on nothing but the fastest PCs and what you'll get is basically a slower machine with a nicer desktop which you'll eventually decide to ditch for the speed gain. At least that's what I always did after trying out this kind of customization stuff. And I said nothing yet about the cost of the <a href="http://www.stardock.com">StarDock</a> software needed to accomplish 'the dream' and about the fact that you can't hide your ugly case and even less the great mess of cables behind it...

Conclusion: If you want a Mac so much isn't it easier to just buy one? ;-)
