I just wanted to mark this important event. Ummm...

Hehe, not that anyone except me really cares but 300 entries are something... Mostly lots and lots of J&aacute;nos' yakkety - yak. There are 82 comments in the current database (there would be hundreds if I'd approve <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2004/06/07/hello_there">comment spam</a> but for obvious reasons I choose not to) and many were lost when I migrated from the old domain. The site in its whole averages about 50 unique visitors per day, of which I know about 10 (some personally and some by exchanging emails or talking via various chat proggies).

My constant readers, who I would here like to thank for their visits and interest.
