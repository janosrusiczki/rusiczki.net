<p><img src="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/openttd_kitsch_transports_26th_april_2006-thumb.gif" width="60" height="60" border="0" alt="A bus riding through a town in Transport Tycoon" class="postimage" /> ... playing way too much Transport Tycoon when just seeing a <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/openttd_kitsch_transports_26th_april_2006.php" onclick="window.open('http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/openttd_kitsch_transports_26th_april_2006.php','popup','width=1024,height=768,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">screenshot</a> makes you right click and drag the mouse to see the rest of the map. As it happened a few days ago. But now seriously, this game puts an incredible spell on me, like no other game does. For example yesterday I fired it up just "to see something" at about 2 PM and there I was seeing my Windows desktop again at 8 PM and wondering just where did the day went?<br />
The game is undoubtedly a masterpiece, and many say that nothing this great was ever created again. This is well confirmed by <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/index.php" title="Transport Tycoon Forums">the huge fanbase</a> and the fact that there are two patches for the game that allow it to be played on modern systems. I haven't really used the <a href="http://www.ttdpatch.net/">TTDPatch</a> (I may have tried it a while ago but I'm not really sure about that), I mostly played <a href="http://www.openttd.com">OpenTTD</a> which is not a patch in fact but a complete open source rewrite of the game.<br />
I hope I won't click the shortcut today because this way my productivity will reach zero in a rather short time.</p>
