<p>Yesterday evening, walking Ioana (as in, Ioana my lovely girlfriend) from my place to her's we were talking technical stuff and I found out that she's got an "internal" e-mail address at the bank where she got hired not so long ago, right after finishing her university. "Internal?" I ask. She supposed it is internal but then she tells me that her workmate watches funny videos almost each day. OK, I was convinced, it's not internal.<br />
So today the mad mail exchanging started. Mails and pictures going, comments coming... I hope her productivity will not plunge drastically and that the mail exchange will not turn out to be problem (because I'm sure that each and every mail I send her ends up in at least one other inbox as well - it's a bank after all) but still I'm glancing at my mail notification utility each 30 seconds or so. I think I'll just configure it with some smooth notification sound. Right away.<br />
<b>UPDATE</b> I received a new e-mail! Hehehe. ;-)</p>
