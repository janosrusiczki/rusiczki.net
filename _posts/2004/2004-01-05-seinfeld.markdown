I must fit my TV tuner back into the computer. It's been collecting dust for more than a year anyway. And now it looks like there's finally something worth seeing on local cable: there are two episodes (I think) of <a href="http://www.spe.sony.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/">Seinfeld</a> each night on <a href="http://www.protv.ro" title="What an absolutely crappy site!">Pro TV</a>.
