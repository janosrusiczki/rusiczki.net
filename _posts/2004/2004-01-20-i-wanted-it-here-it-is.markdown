The first obviously brought the second even if the second was theoretically here a long time ago. What a philosopher I am.

I hope it'll continue to snow and that it will stick around for a while (as it did last year) because I really want to go and ride a little. A friend promised me we'll go skiing / boarding on Saturday but I obviously had to discover that I'm having an exam on that day. Arrrgh. And it would be cool if I'd have it in the morning, because after finishing with it, I'd come home, grab my equipment and in one hour I'd be on the slopes. But of course it has to start at 2PM so all my Saturday is messed up... Double Arrrgh. I'm a bit upset.

But it continues to snow and this makes me so happy!
