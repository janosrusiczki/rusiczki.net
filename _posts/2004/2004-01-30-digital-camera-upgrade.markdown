No. I can't really stop doing this. Namely, I can't stop buying myself stuff. Electronic stuff. Also known as gadgets. So, let's see what's in the bag.

After getting that absolutely gorgeous iPod which I just <i>can't</i> leave at home wherever I go, I finalized a quite good deal to upgrade my Canon digital camera. I have the stone age old PowerShot A20 which was discontinued a month or two after I bought it so I was enviously looking at the new features that the A40 had. Now this model also got discontinued and the top of the line is the A80 with it's 4 (!!!) megapixels. But I don't need that much. In fact I don't need 3 megapixels. And, as I think of it I don't even need the 2 I have available because most of the time I keep my camera set to 1024 x 768 switching it to 1600 x 1200 only if I take a landscape shot or if I'm photographing some other really important thing. But most of the time 1024 x 768 is sufficient for me. That's why I have decided to go for the <a href="http://www.powershot.com/powershot2/a70-60/index.html" title="Absolutely wonderful digital camera!">Canon PowerShot A60</a>. It's got better AiAF (Artificial Intelligence Auto Focus) than the A40 which at it's turn is better than the A20. The Movie mode should also come in handy to make those funny moments everlasting. And last but not least it looks a lot sleeker than the A20. The guy who's selling it should send it on Monday so I should have on on Tuesday or Wednesday. I can barely wait to put my fingers on it. Yayks!
