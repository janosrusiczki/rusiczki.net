Sitting in front of my computer. Clicking this and that while banging the speakers with Tom Middleton's remix of Rob Dougan's <i>Clubbed to Death</i>.

OK, OK, but what's wrong with that? Nothing really, just the small fact that it's Saturday night. It's so ugly when your favourite club closes. Favourite is in fact a bit too much to say, but having no place cool to go out during the weekend is a completely different story.

Spending Saturday night on the Net can be really depressing for me... Well, time to log into Yahoo! Messenger and see who's online...
