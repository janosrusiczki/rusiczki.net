And what do I find? My good old Massive Attack CD. The one which didn't want to properly play on my 'puter. And <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2003/04/05/cd-copy-protection-and-shit/" title="Kitsched - CD Copy protection and shit...">I was making a case out of it</a> back in April last year.

Anyway since I posted that swearing entry, one day I took a magic marker and made the margin of the CD black as instructed in so many guides. But that way my PC completely refused to read it. The CD-ROM actually made some funny noises when I inserted the disc, so I stopped trying, not wanting to damage neither the CD, neither my drive. I borrowed the album to someone in the meantime and I was relieved to find out it plays on standard CD players.

So, I took the CD off the shelves today and inserted it into the PlayStation. It read it in no time. So now I'm listening to the gorgeous voice of Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor singing 'Prayer for England' which is probably my favourite song on the album.
