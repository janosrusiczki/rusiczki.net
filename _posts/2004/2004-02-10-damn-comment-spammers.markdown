I've just deleted the first 4 spam comments of my blog. Part of me is happy: I've been noticed and it looks like my weblog "counts" for someone out there, or at least for Google. But the rest of me, the bigger part, is sad: it's more than enough to deal with Internet trash in my email... I've banned one IP, but I don't think it counts too much as there are thousands of proxies out there.

The strange part is that earlier today I read an interesting post on [solving comment spam](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/01/28/solvingCommentSpam) in [Simon Willison's Weblog](http://simon.incutio.com/) and I was thinking: phew, I'm glad this kind of crap didn't happen to me yet. Well... It did now.

**UPDATE:** I downloaded and installed Jay Allen's [MT-Blacklist](http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/ "MT-Blacklist/Comment Spam Clearinghouse") plugin just so I won't have nightmares with comment spam clogging my beloved weblog. Also updated [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org) to the latest version as of this writing which is 2.661.
