Badly. In fact I never ever seen weather like we had today. It snowed all through last night and most of today so there's quite a quantity of snow. But this wasn't enough as the punishment for the minispring we were given a few days ago. The wind started blowing. Hard. I look out and it looks like Siberia. Not that I ever saw Siberia. Brrr!
