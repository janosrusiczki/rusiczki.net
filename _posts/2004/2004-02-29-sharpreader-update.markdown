While downloading it I thought I'd post this. The latest <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">Sharpreader</a> (my choice for a Windows news aggregator) is now version 0.9.4.0. Judging from the upgrade notes the greatest news is that it supports <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/">ATOM</a> feeds now. That's a noteworthy feature I actually mailed Mr. Hutteman about. Got no answer but that's not really a problem since it's now done. I'll discover the rest of the included goodies after the download is done.
