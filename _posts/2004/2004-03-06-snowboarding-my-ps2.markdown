There was nothing in the mailbox today. I thought my copy of SSX 3 would arrive today but it looks like I'll have to wait until Monday.

From the moment I ordered the game I entered a state that resembles that of a kid's before Christmas. I shelled out an awful amount of money for it so I hope it will at least live up to my expectations. But judging from the raving reviews it got I think it will. <a href="http://www.ratchetandclankgadgets.com">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a>, the previous game I bought for the PS2 turned out to be incredible fun. And I bought that one judging from the reviews I read and TV presentations I saw. And because it had a special low price at <a href="http://www.dol.ro">Diverta Online</a>, hehe.

I also ordered a <a href="http://www.dms3.com">DMS3</a> modchip for my beloved second hand console. So I'll be able to play backed up games (not necessarily backed up by me) and play DivX movies on my TV. I got scared when I looked at the installation guide for the modchip. So many small soldering points... But I think I'll let someone with more experience install it. Someone who already modded PS2-s. And I'm also waiting for an EZ Flash linker for my GameBoy Advance.

It seems like I'm looking forward for some serious gaming. God, when will I find time to do some work? And what about going to school? Uhoh!
