It was cool to find <a href="http://www.snowboard.ro/index.php?location=gallery" title="The numbered ones are mine">my pictures</a> from last year's Big Air Competition @ Mogosa on a site. It means they're appreciated. Or there were no other pictures to choose from. But it's fairly uncool that I found them accidentally. As in: they haven't asked for my permission to publish them, probably because they had no ideea who shot them.

Still? What can I do? Well, maybe I'll be a little more careful this year and won't distribute them to almost everyone as I did last year. Ehehe. Evil thoughts...

<b>UPDATE:</b> Issue solved by sending a private message to the site's administrator. Now I'm credited and I feel a lot better.
