Lately I uploaded some video content for friends and forum buddies and I thought that since I made kind of an effort to upload them (dial-up, as we all know, purely rules!) I should make them publicly available. So here they are:

<ul>
<li>Here's me zapping with Kaori through the R&amp;B track in SSX3 - <a href="https://content.rusiczki.net/blogstuff/ssx3.avi">DivX 5 - 3.15 MB</a></li>
<li>Deekline (<a href="http://www.ratrecords.info/">Rat Recordings, UK</a>) is throwing some insane beats and people are cheering accordingly at the Evolution club in Timisoara - <a href="https://content.rusiczki.net/blogstuff/deekline-1.avi">DivX 3.1 - 2.52 MB</a></li>
<li>The same insane party as above and this time the crowd goes wild with Rennie Pilgrem's <i>London Voodoo</i> - <a href="https://content.rusiczki.net/blogstuff/deekline-2.avi">DivX 3.1 - 974 kB</a></li>
</ul>
The sound quality sucks for both of the party clips but at least I learned that when I'm filming in clubs I should probably cover the mic on the PowerShot with my finger to attenuate the sound level...
