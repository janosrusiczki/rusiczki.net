I was out for the very end of last weekend and the start of this week. I had a thought on Sunday afternoon and the next thing was that I climbed the bus and I was on my way to Cluj-Napoca. I had a lovely girlfriend and an iPod battery waiting for me after all. And boy, we had some great fun these days!

We walked around the town a lot so I took some pictures as I realized that even though I visited Cluj probably a million times I have almost no pictures of the town itself. Haven't shot that many pictures this time either and even fewer made it to <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/gallery/">my gallery</a> but I promised myself that from now on I'll dedicate some space on my compact flash card for the picutres of the towns I visit themselves. Also shot some pics in Insomnia, a bar which impressed me a lot.

Saw a movie. And not any movie, a Jack Nicholson movie! If I had to rate it I'd rate <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337741/">Something's Gotta Give</a> at about 8 or 8.5 out of 10. Nice movie but a little long for my taste. Nicholson plays well, Keaton plays even better and Amanda Peet is simply lovely as usual. If I'd be a woman I'd surely voice my opionion about Keanu Reeves but as I'm not I'll simply say that he was OK. This movie was a first for me as I never been to a movie theater which featured surround sound before...

We visited a reptile expo and I'm sure that if I sum all the snakes I saw in my life I would get the one-fifth of the number I saw there. It was scary. And yukky. But none the less very interesting and entertaining! The expo also featured some lizard class creatures and two monkeys which we watched for several minutes and never got bored of them.

The bar of choice was Zorro (spent one of the three nights there) even if it's a rock bar (?) and the dining place of choice was Speed (they have one great shaorma!). Got my iPod battery. I is very happy!
