Today I received the first feedback email from a person completely unknown to me who told me that he reads these babblings regularly. Well, what can I say other than this one email really put a big smile on my face.

I've been asked if I plan posting in Romanian or Hungarian and I answered that I don't know. Because I really don't know. First of all I should at least give a final form to this site before I even start thinking about stuff like that. All those unfinished sections are bad to look at...

Anyway, thanks for your kind words <a href="http://www.timbru.com/">Gabriel</a>.
