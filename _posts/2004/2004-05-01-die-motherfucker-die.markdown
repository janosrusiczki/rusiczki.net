Some asswipe posted about 50 comments leading to a hive of ghost sites linking each other and opening popups with casino sites. He was using an interesting technique or there were several persons involved because the spam comments just kept coming and coming and <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">MT-Blacklist</a> was of no real use. So I ended up renaming my mt-comments.cgi and banning about 10 IP addresses until I figure out a way to block these scumbags.

If you read this you can bite me suckers!

<b>UPDATE</b> I think I succeeded in banning the whole hive of addresses this sucker created. So mt-comments.cgi is back in place. Comment away!
