OK. Lately I must try to send a mail at least 5 or 6 times until my e-mail client finally succeeds connecting to the <a href="http://www.rdsnet.ro/" title="'Premium Quality' Romanian ISP">RDS</a> SMTP server. I don't know, but is it <b>that hard</b> to keep that damn mail server in a fair shape? Since 2 or 3 months there are constant problems with it. Earlier <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2004/04/13/way-to-go-rds/" title="Kitsched - Way to go RDS!">I received everything with a huge delay</a> and nowadays I can't even send. I don't want to bash them constantly or something but the inability to send and receive e-mail is really annoying since it's one of the basic and most used features this Internet thingie offers...
