After 25 years of living with my parents and in their house I'm finally taking the big step: I'm moving out. The plan for the moment is to rent an appartment with 2 rooms in Baia Mare and right now I'm in the stage of browsing the ads to find something cool. My French partner will arrive on Friday so I will be rather busy for the next 2 weeks or so getting the appartment rented and installing the permanent Internet connection. This next period will be really mad so wish me a lot of luck. I can barely wait to have my own place even if I'll have to come home each afternoon to eat a hot soup...

But I bet it'll be different.
