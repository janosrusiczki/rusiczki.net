While almost all the weblogging community is [bragging about it](http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/its_about_time.shtml), in all this rush with the new appartment and everything I just took [it](http://www.movabletype.org "Movable Type 3.0D") and installed it. It went through without any problems and it works OK as I came to expect from a [6A](http://www.sixapart.com "Six Apart") product but the added features are a little too few to justify the new pricing schemes... Just my $0.02. I only have one weblog (this) so the licensing is not really a big problem for me. And I'm sure I won't switch to other publishing systems soon... I'm just not in the mood and I really have no time for any [upgrades](http://blog.carthik.net/vault/2004/05/14/movabletype-to-wordpress/ "Moving from Movable Type to WordPress @ Carthik.net") now.
