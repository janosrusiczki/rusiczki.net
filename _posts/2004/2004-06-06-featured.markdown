Wow!

Studying my referers I noticed quite a few incoming hits from <a href="http://mattwelch.com/warblog.html">Matt Welch's weblog</a> and upon checking the site I found his post named '<a title="What Are Your Favorite Romanian Websites?" href="http://www.mattwelch.com/archives/week_2004_05_30.html#2655">What Are Your Favorite Romanian Websites?</a>' which is a short list of Romanian weblogs. I'm featured alongside sites like Dragos Novac's <a href="http://www.argumente.ro">@rgumente</a>, Douglas and Claudia Muir's <a href="http://www.bookcase.com/~claudia/mt/">Halfway Down the Danube</a> and Christian Paul's <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/cpaul/iblog/index.html">Kit Blog</a> just to name the Romanian weblogs I already knew about, read and respect. As usual I also found some new bookmarks which will probably appear shortly in my left sidebar. <a href="http://perfectlyimperfect.blogspot.com/">Perfectly Imperfect</a> for example looks like quite a good read.

Anyway I'm really happy that I got my blog mentioned.
