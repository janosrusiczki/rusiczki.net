I had some luck and saw someone giving away free <a href="http://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a> invites on a forum. And I actually requested one and the guy said he sent it. But stupid me, I gave a very unstable email account for the contact address because it's a rather public forum (a newsgroup in fact) and that account is full of spam anyway. But now, just to raise my adrenaline level I can't login to that account.

Heeelp! I'm biting my fingernails off.

<b>UPDATE</b>

OK, the 'painful' wait is over and I'm in.

It looks that they've piled up a few <a href="http://www.google.com/gmail/help/start.html" title="Getting started with Gmail">great ideas</a> there, like the 'conversation' concept which lets you view an entire chain of 'Re, Re, Re's on one page, the labels which are basically categories for your emails and you can assign more than one label to a specific mail or conversation and obviously the 1 gigabytes of storage space for your emails you get for free. I think because of these features I will start using it alongside my trusty old Yahoo! Mail account which I'm paying for since the begining of this year and which <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2004/06/15/yahoo-mail-strikes-back/" title="Kitsched - Yahoo! Mail strikes back!">was upgraded recently</a> and nowadays offers 2 gigabytes of storage space for it's paying members' emails and my other personal accounts (two on RDS, two on this domain, one on drumandbass.ro and one on plic.ro) all of which <a href="http://www.poptray.org/" title="PopTray Mail Notifier - great POP email notifier">PopTray</a> checks every 10 minutes.

It's great to test out Gmail and even more so it's great knowing that I'm doing it before it's available to the wider public. Although of what I've read it shouldn't take very long now until they'll start letting people sign-up the usual way. One or two weeks. But still, it's very very geeky to be able to beta test a service everyone is raving about!

So all you botties out there come and harvest and from now on start sending that spam to janos dot rusiczki at google's email service dot com.
