Oh joy!

Yesterday Ioana and me recovered part of the holiday we never had this summer. As she is stuck in front of her computer because of her looming graduation which is coming to a university near you (if you live in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, that is) sometime by the end of this August. And I'm stuck in front of mine with work. Lots of work. I'm just about finished with one project, but I'm already starting another one. And it's not a small one. We're both stressed to the max and this is certainly not good. Ugh!

Yesterday was a very nice day though. We woke up early at about 3 in the afternoon (ehem), ate and then headed to Baia Sprie to my parents house. We've been caught by the rain just a few meters away from the house but we've been caught bad. Our cloathes were soaking wet by the time we reached our destination, but this was the last bad point of the day. After we hung up everything to dry we went to the kitchen and ate the best soup we ate as of late. Father could be called a culinary genius when it comes to Hungarian cuisine and this soup was one of his best. And then it was time for some tasty watermelon of which I can never get enough. In fact I can't really get enough of any sweet fruit but that's another story... After our tummies were filled we sat and talked with my parents and then went channel zapping on the TV in my room. When we weren't watching the TV we went out in the garden and had fun of the cats that were seriously in love. Haha. Than ate some more, this time some corn. And then I caught some zees.

We came back to Baia Mare at about 11 PM and went to the disco (yep, on Sunday night) and it just turned out great because some local dudes were showing off their techno productions which weren't bad at all. Did some dancing and stuff. After all this we went to Ioana's place, saw about half of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188674/" title="Hillarious movie!">Human Traffic</a> and then we called it a day.

And what a day!
