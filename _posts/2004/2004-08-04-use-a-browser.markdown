Boys and girls. If you really want to enjoy browsing again without worring about how much spyware and viruses will you get as an unwelcomed gift after a browsing session with our belowed Internet Explorer do yourself a favour and get a real browser (instead of getting antispyware and antiviruses).

You do have choices, you know.

My choice, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com">Mozilla's</a> name sounds too geeky according to <a href="http://www.rola.ro/lmarin/">some</a> and it's true it's a bit bloated for a dial-up download although it contains much more that just a browser, but you can't have any objection against it's smaller brother, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>. It's got a cool name (as it seems that this matters to some, ehem), it's a small download (4,7 megabytes currently), it has superb functionality, it looks great and it's the coolest thing since sliced bread. Honest!

And that's about all the baptism I'll post for a while, but I really wanted to post this.
