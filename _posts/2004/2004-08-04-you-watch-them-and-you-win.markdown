So, why <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2004/08/04/morning-tv-session/" title="Kitsched - Morning TV session">did I say</a> that I like the news on ProTV so much?

<img src="https://content.rusiczki.net/blogpics/stirile_protv.jpg" width="121" height="82" border="0" alt="The opening titles for the ProTV News" class="postimage" /> Just for the sake of their plain stupidity. Want to eat but you don't have the money for food? Or do you want to loose some weight quick? No problem, just switch to <a href="http://www.protv.ro">ProTV</a> at 5 in the afternoon and you're guaranteed to loose your apetite or even worse. I mean, are those news? They hunt down the filthiest, bloodiest stories just to have some news material to fill that much advertised hour... Or if there's a lack of accidents and / or crimes don't panic, there come the banalities! As a random example, is it really a news that should be aired on television that a family had a hornet nest in their home? Or that a stork made a nest a little later or earlier than it was supposed it? I really wished to bring up some more examples but unfortunately my mind fails me. I'm sorry but I just can't remember such nonsense.

Hmmm. I don't know where <a href="http://www.libertatea.ro/img/photoarchive/4-5_oameni_21_4256.gif" title="Picture of Catalin Radu Tanase with his wife">Catalin Radu Tanase</a> is nowadays but he was the best news riporter ever as they always sent him to where the bloodiest and most ugly accidents happened and put him as near to the police marks as they could. And he always pronounced the word 'blood' with such enthusiasm that for a while I was suspecting he's having an orgasm each time he says it. Judging from the <a href="http://www.phg.ro/stire.php?id=3725" title="News about him getting married - in Romanian">latest news</a> he's probably enjoying he's honeymoon in pool of blood somewhere. Well, I made up the part about the pool of blood...

Then there was a time when they thought the mosaic news ruled. I mean, what the Hell? Did they really think that viewers enjoyed seeing blurred out images during about one fourth of the time of the news? I mean OK, there came the new law or whatever that made them afraid of showing people's faces without asking for their consent but come on, they could've showed something else. I remember seeing an interview of about a minute in which half of the image was blurred out and the only thing the viewer could see was part of a yellow wall with a nice white wall outlet.

Oh and there were the news which were made into movies. With soundtracks, titles and nice reconstructions of the events. Of course they made movies only from the news that featured the bloodiest and most violent events. And I do like that they never forget to tape the howling mother / father / sister / brother. Just to make absolutely sure that the viewers feel THE PAIN. And then some more blood. And that about concludes it ladies and gentlemen, back to <a href="http://e-gmp.netfirms.com/esca.html" title="A truely nice clip with Esca">Andreea Esca's</a> face who's ready to announce the next horror.

Why do I watch them? The answer lies somewhere along the one to: 'Why do I visit <a href="http://www.entensity.net">Entensity</a>'?
