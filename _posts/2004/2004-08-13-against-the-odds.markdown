I think I couldn't find a four leaf clover on a better date. As it's Friday the 13th today and just as I was leaving my parents house today at around noon, what do I see right next to the gate? Yup!

But I wasn't selfish. I gave it to my girlfriend as she will soon need a lot more luck than myself... Graduation.
