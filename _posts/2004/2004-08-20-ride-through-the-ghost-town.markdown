After seeing the great trailers for the really-really promising game <a href="http://www.stalker-game.com/" title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</a> out of pure curiosity I searched for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=chernobyl">Chernobyl</a> on Google. And through the cached version of a page on Angelfire I reached a site with pictures made by a biker who made several trips to and through the ghost town and it's surrounding area.

The pictures and the accompanying text left me absolutely speechless, just staring at the monitor with a knot in my throat...

Here's the link: <a href="http://www.kiddofspeed.com/chapter1.html" title="Kiddofspeed - GHOST TOWN - Chernobyl Pictures - Elena's Motorcyle Ride through Chernobyl">Elena's Motorcyle Ride through Chernobyl</a>.

<b>UPDATE</b>

Ah, as always it turns that the motorcycle ride stuff was <a href="http://www.uer.ca/forum_showthread.asp?fid=1&threadid=8951">complete bullshit</a> and much of the story as well... Ehm, it was a good and emotional read.

Pulse's post on that forum thread was a worthy read and the <a href="http://www.web-axis.net/~pulse/chernobyl/prypyat-panoramic.jpg">panoramic picture</a> he took from the top of the highest building in Pripyat is also worth looking.

What I remember about the accident is that I was a few days older than 7 and I was at my Grandma's probably playing with the presents I got for my birthday on the 17th and when my mother came over we (my cousin and me) had to take some sweety pills (iodide).
