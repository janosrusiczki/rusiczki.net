I'm with <a href="http://www.argumente.ro">Dragos</a> on this one. There are way too many incoming invites, everybody is giving them away on blogs and forums so I guess he's right, <a href="http://www.argumente.ro/general/8944551149/index_html">the service will probably go public soon</a>.

Ah, in case you're interested I have four more invites. Just drop a comment if you need one. Note that there's no need to post a comment twice. The comments on my blog are moderated so they will not appear on the site right as you post them but only after I approve them. Comment spam was irritating and I picked this solution to eliminate it. Completely.
