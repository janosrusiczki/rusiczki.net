![Cascading Style Cheatsheet](https://content.rusiczki.net/blogpics/cascading_style_cheatsheet.jpg)

Yesterday night I printed the Cascading Style Cheatsheet put together by Brett Merkey, which will surely come in handy a number of times. My linkblog was very handy this time as I have no printer of my own and I was over at a friend who I asked if I could print. And there I was, two clicks and the printer was busy. Thanks Peti.
