![MT-Blacklist Statistics](https://content.rusiczki.net/blogpics/mt_blacklist_stats.gif)

It's working! Not one spam comment went through since [I installed it](http://www.rusiczki.net/2004/11/01/mt-3121-dynamic-pages-and-the-return-of-the-blacklist/) two days ago, it blocked 22 because they matched 'cialis' and forced me to moderate another two of them because they were added to older entries. That's what I call a smart plug-in! Kudos to the author, [Jay Allen](http://www.jayallen.org/).

As another conclusion it looks like changing the name of the comment script had no effect and this could mean one of two things: they have smart little bots or all the comments are added by hand. If it's the latter case, I wonder where do they get all the workforce? It must be one hell of a boring job!
