Not one spam comment went through since <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2004/11/01/mt-3121-dynamic-pages-and-the-return-of-the-blacklist/">I installed it</a> two days ago, it blocked 22 because they matched 'cialis' and forced me to moderate another two of them because they were added to older entries. That's what I call a smart plug-in! Kudos to the author, <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/">Jay Allen</a>.

As another conclusion it looks like changing the name of the comment script had no effect and this could mean one of two things: they have smart little bots or all the comments are added by hand. If it's the latter case, I wonder where do they get all the workforce? It must be one hell of a boring job!
