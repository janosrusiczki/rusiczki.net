Whooppie! No, I don't want to upset [anyone](http://www.supermagnet.ro/deea/index.php?p=57), I just wanted to express my joy. The interesting fact is that only two of the t-shirts from all those in that big box are ours (the ones in the middle picture), the rest of them will continue their travel to Bucharest tomorrow... And the novelty this time are the stickers as I never got any from [Threadless](http://www.threadless.com) before.
