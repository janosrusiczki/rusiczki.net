<p>After a almost 2 years... It was time for a fresh Windows install. Mostly because my svchost.exe would take on some power rides during which it would eat 99% of the CPU. And I can tell you that this is really annoying. I have a truly handy boot CD containing all the utilities needed to put a PC back on it's legs, which I updated with the latest virus definitions, booted it, let it scan everything, but neither F-Prot nor McAffe found anything. No virus. No spyware. No nothing. And still svchost.exe was driving my CPU and myself crazy. So I took a deep breath and with a quick hand movement formatted my C drive and then installed a shiny brand new copy of Windows. The SP2 flavour. It shouldn't give me headaches for a while. Or at least that's what I hope.<br />
Unfortunately I forgot about backing up some stuff though: my Firefox bookmarks are all gone (thank God for <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>), also my FTP configurations from Total Commander went to the eternal byte fields. Time to set them up again. But hey! In exchange I rediscovered that I have a 1.66 GHz CPU. Not a freakin' slug.<br />
I couldn't start explaining how much I envy one of my friends (hello Cosmo!) and for that matter anyone who owns a Mac. :-)</p>
