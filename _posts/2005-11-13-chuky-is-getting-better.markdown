<p>Story: He was hit by a taxi which broke his leg right in front of my girlfriend's brother one night a while ago. They took him to the vet and since the original owner didn't show up they got stuck with him. But "stuck" isn't the best word to describe this situation, because he's really funny (crazy) and he earned the love of all the family. The following Tuesday will mark his last trip to the vet. At least concerning his leg.  So, he'll be free to run like crazy. As he already does anyway...</p>
