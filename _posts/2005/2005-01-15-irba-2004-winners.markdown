No, I didn't grab anything, not even a third prize. Not that I was nominated in that many categories, but I guess that this is the prize for my laziness to write entries and even to urge people to vote for me. :-)

For those interested there's <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/cpaul/iblog/C1156848003/E1664537946/index.html">a really short sum up of the winners</a> on <a href="http://www.kitblog.com">Cristian Paul's blog</a>. Unfortunately I can't link to the official results, and there will probably be no IRBA 2005. And that's because <a href="http://www.individualism.ro">Gabriel</a> suddenly decided to take his blog offline. All the links give nice 404s. I wonder, could it be related to <a href="http://www.troniu.dk/index.php?c=1536">this</a>?

Anyway, next year get ready for k!RBA. Now guess what that 'k!' stands for. Or well, maybe not. Hehe.
