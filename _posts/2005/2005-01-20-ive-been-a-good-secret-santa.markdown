It all started with <a href="http://www.timbru.com/jurnal/2004/Nov/secret_santa_2004">an entry</a> in <a href="http://www.timbru.com/jurnal/">Gabriel Radic's weblog</a> that arrived in my feed reader sometime by the end of November. After reading the entry, a few clicks and some form filling I was part of <a href="http://www.thinkblank.com/santa2004/">Secret Santa 2004</a>.

Some time passed and on December the 10th an e-mail arrived containing the name, e-mail, <a href="http://blog.zoctagon.com" title="At the moment I'm writing this the link doesn't work">web address</a> and a link to the wishlist of the person I was supposed to surprise with a Christmas present. Unfortunately back then I was really low on money (as I am now as a matter of fact) but I promised myself that I'm going to get Kevin something cool.

Fast forward four days and an e-mail arrives from a certain Andrew explaining me that he just ordered my gift and apologizing because Amazon estimated that it'll only arrive around the 10th of January. Now that short mail not only made my day but probably my week and a lot more! I wrote back quickly sending lots of thanks and guiltilly thinking that I still had no money to get anything to the guy who I was supposed to surprise. And then I spent a few days looking at my Amazon wishlist hovering the button hiding the items that were already purchased and holding back my urge to click it just to keep the surprise factor. But finally my curiosity won and I gave in... And found out that a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000053W5A/">two disc DVD version of Snatch</a> was on it's way to my parent's house in Baia Sprie. Now that was some awsome news!

A few days before Christmas I finally received some well earned money and as such I finally got around and ordered Kevin <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000026YEO/">a Pixies CD</a>. As he was from UK, amazon.co.uk estimated that the package will arrive just before Christmas. So, eventually everything was OK and I only had to sit around and wait for a few days, and <em>voila!</em> exactly a month after passing the order, on the 15th of January 2005 my package arrived! Nowadays I'm really busy watching all the special features the two discs are packed with.

Thank you Gabi for the link that got me into the game in the first place and thank you Andy for the fantastic gift!
