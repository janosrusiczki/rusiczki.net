All this time I've been living in error! I thought I'm not selling anything through this site but there came <a href="http://www.google.com" title="Praise thy o' great search engine">Google</a> to <a href="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=rusiczki&amp;filter=0">prove me wrong</a>. It looks like they (as in they = Froogle's algorithms) decided that you can buy my TMBase badge from 2003 for $20. And I'm not even bothering to understand what I'm selling on my page containing an entry about the mIRC registration page. It's waaay too twisted...

Here's <a href="https://content.rusiczki.net/blogpics/froogle_loves_me.php" onclick="window.open('https://content.rusiczki.net/blogpics/froogle_loves_me.php','popup','width=877,height=361,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">a screenshot</a> just in case the results vanish over the night. And no, I'm not selling that badge.
