If anyone could trace or knows the forum where this guy initially posted <a href="http://www.lug.ro/mlist/archive/humor/humor.2005-04/att-0055/ovidiu.zip">these memories</a> (in Romanian) and would share the URL with me I would be sooo glad! Basically it's a 34 page MS Word document with recollections about sharing an appartment with a mad man. And when I say 'mad' I mean proper mad, with the "red stripe" and everything. The author has a really nice writing style that reminds me of, well, Ion Creanga and reading the .doc entertained me for almost a whole afternoon. I Googled text parts and everything but found nothing and I'm intrigued because maybe he posted new chapters as in the last message / chapter he says something about the year's end...

I found the .doc browsing the <a href="http://www.lug.ro">RLUG's</a> (Romanian Linux Users Group) <a href="http://www.lug.ro/mlist/archive/humor/humor.2005-04/0055.html">humor list archives</a>.

<b>UPDATE</b> Thanks to Vlad (<a href="http://electronic.idilis.ro/index.html">Bits of Reality</a>) I now have the URL of the <a href="http://forum.oltcit.ro/viewtopic.php?t=507">original forum thread</a> where the stories contained in the .doc were posted and so I can keep an eye out for any new "episodes". Muchos gracias!
