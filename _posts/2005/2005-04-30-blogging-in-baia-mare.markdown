Well, well, well... What do you know?

For a while me, myself and I was the only one I knew (isn't that a bit selfish?) that was blogging from this God forsaken city. In fact for a while I was bloggin' from Baia Sprie (even more God forsaken). And now, look! There are a myriad of weblogs based in Baia Mare (and powered by Blogger) and as I understand there was even <a href="http://gabrielia.blogspot.com/2005/04/cum-fost-la-baia-mare-vineri.html">a conference</a> and <a href="http://gabrielia.blogspot.com/2005/04/despre-bloguri-si-sansele-noii.html">a workshop</a> held one of these weeks at <a href="http://www.ubm.ro">UBM</a> (<a href="http://www.ubm.ro">North University of Baia Mare</a>) about blogging. The (main) speaker was <a href="http://www.gabriela.avram.go.ro/">Gabriela Avram</a> of <a href="http://www.prinsea.net">Prinsea</a>, <a href="http://cursroblogs.blogspot.com/">RoBlogs</a> and <a href="http://gabrielia.blogspot.com/">Gabrielia</a> fame and the organizer was professor <a href="http://nerezonabilulprofesor.blogspot.com/">Mircea Lobontiu</a>. It looks like this world is truly small, but I'm still sad I heard / read nothing about the event before it actually happened and as such I couldn't attend. Well, that's what happens when you ignore the FeedDemon icon on your desktop for weeks...

Anyway: go, go, go Baia Mare!
