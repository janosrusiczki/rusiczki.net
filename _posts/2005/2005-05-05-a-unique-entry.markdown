Notice that this entry was posted on 05-05-05 at 05:05:05. And notice that the calendars will show 05-05-05 again in exactly 100 years. Also notice that today is thursday which is the 5th day of the week. This combination will occur again in about 7000 years. OK, I admit that I wasn't awake at 5 in the morning to post this but instead I tweaked the post's timestamp for the full effect. Anyway, at least I posted this 30 minutes before 5 PM...
