Stuff worth mentioning (in no particular order, as usual):

<ul>
<li>This entry is being posted using the shiny new <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/news/2005/08/movable_type_3_2.html">Movable Type 3.2</a> and the coluorful background of the site is now officially back after two months of mourning - hit refresh if it doesn't show;</li>
<li>I'm number 26 in <a href="http://www.timsoft.ro/weblog/index.php?title=un_top_al_weblogurilor_romanesti_avem_we&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">a top of the Romanian weblogs</a> made by Carmen @ Timsoft - this is nice, considering that I'm posting about 1 entry per month...</li>
<li>I have to renew <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/">this domain</a> in a few days (2 years of rusiczki.net already, wow!)</li>
<li>It was a WET summer;</li>
<li><a href="http://perfectlyimperfect.blogspot.com/patric_tina.jpg">Tina revealed herself</a> at one of the first and friendliest blogger meetings (it's been covered all around, it happened far away from my location and as such I didn't attend, so I'm not going to write about it);</li>
<li>I'm dreaming about <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/etrex/">a basic GPS</a> but I'm in an ugly money hole;</li>
<li>I fell in love with psytrance;</li>
<li><a href="http://grafic.uv.ro">grafic</a> launched - it's a blog with lots of nice pics and next to no text;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.timbru.com">Timbru</a> more or less closed - too bad, I liked Gabi's entries a lot;</li>
<li>My next dog (if it'll be a female) will be called Dashenka.</li>
</ul>
That's all folks. At least for now...
