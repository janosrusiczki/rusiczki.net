Stuff worth mentioning (in no particular order, as usual):

* This entry is being posted using the shiny new [Movable Type 3.2](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/news/2005/08/movable_type_3_2.html) and the coluorful background of the site is now officially back after two months of mourning - hit refresh if it doesn't show;
* I'm number 26 in [a top of the Romanian weblogs](http://www.timsoft.ro/weblog/index.php?title=un_top_al_weblogurilor_romanesti_avem_we&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1) made by Carmen @ Timsoft - this is nice, considering that I'm posting about 1 entry per month...
* I have to renew [this domain](http://www.rusiczki.net/) in a few days (2 years of rusiczki.net already, wow!)
* It was a WET summer;
* [Tina revealed herself](http://perfectlyimperfect.blogspot.com/patric_tina.jpg) at one of the first and friendliest blogger meetings (it's been covered all around, it happened far away from my location and as such I didn't attend, so I'm not going to write about it);
* I'm dreaming about [a basic GPS](http://www.garmin.com/products/etrex/) but I'm in an ugly money hole;
* I fell in love with psytrance;
* [grafic](http://grafic.uv.ro) launched - it's a blog with lots of nice pics and next to no text;
* [Timbru](http://www.timbru.com) more or less closed - too bad, I liked Gabi's entries a lot;
* My next dog (if it'll be a female) will be called Dashenka.

That's all folks. At least for now...
