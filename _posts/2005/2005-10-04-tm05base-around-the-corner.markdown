Yep, here it is ladies and gentlemen: the promo in <a href="http://www.tmbase.ro/tm05base/promo/tm05base_large.mov">high (3 MB)</a> and <a href="http://www.tmbase.ro/tm05base/promo/tm05base_small.mov">low (900 kB)</a> quality (QuickTime is a must). Take your pick. Plus there's the <a href="http://tmbase.ro/tm05base/main02.htm">mini site</a> dedicated to the festival which is choc full of useful infos. Enjoy, drool and get ready for the event itself, because it'll ROCK!
