(Can you spot the thin white coating on everything?) 

Even if it's probably just a "preview". Even if this round will go away and we'll have about a month of bone crunching pure cold without any snow. Must concentrate on the important aspect at hand: after a year of waiting winter has finally arrived! Heheeey, slopes, here I come!

PS. Please excuse the "artistic" quality of this pic... I just snapped it.
