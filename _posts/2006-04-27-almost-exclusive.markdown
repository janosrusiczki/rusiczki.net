Wow, I'm kind of switching over to tabloid style but this time it's worth it...

Yesterday I was working to set up Windows on my boss' new laptop (with all the headaches associated with the fact that there's no SATA driver included on the default Windows setup CD) and when I returned to my computer I found a bounch of ecstatic messages from a friend who, well, who's got plenty of time to waste at his workplace. He was raving about how he finally succeeded in filming some pickpockets in action. And he asked me if I'm interested to put it on the site I'm working on at the company (kind of a portal for Baia Mare). I wasn't really impressed by what he was saying but then he sent me the movie file and after the first view I was hooked. Because what I saw was incredible! A gang of 4 thieves stealing what I think is a phone from a poor guy who made the mistake to put his jacket on his back and stop at the lights. It's not that they steal something hugely valuable, but the way they do it is simply amazing. I watched it over and over and I must say that the level of choreography and the precision is mind blowing! I don't know if this comes from practice or it's just natural but, wow...

Oh, and on the techincal side I must note that Baia Mare Online's <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/bmo_stats_pickpockets.php" onclick="window.open('http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/bmo_stats_pickpockets.php','popup','width=768,height=222,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">stats</a> went through the roof. At least compared to the usual traffic we are experiencing a huge spike...
