Been to the Siromex Rally yesterday, shoot a bunch of pictures and here's a "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janos/tags/rally/">best of</a>" selected and cropped just for you, my faithful readers (and for the rest of the Internet for that matter). This is a funny occasion as I remember that last year I kind of kicked off my Flickr experience with the rally photos, which I later deleted because they were uploaded kind of bulk style and had almost no views, plus there was no other way of getting rid of the set that was containing them (any tips?). I also remember that uploading those pics was one of the first things I did in one of my first free moments at <a href="http://www.softzone.ro">SoftZone</a>, being a new employee and all that...
