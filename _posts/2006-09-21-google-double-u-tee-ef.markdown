I did a <a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html#sitesearch">site: search</a> on Google for my <a href="http://www.woodprofit.com">wooden products trading site</a> to see what's the indexed page count and look what the great G <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/woodprofit-site-search.php">showed me</a>. Can anyone explain? And as of writing this it's a reproductible "thing". If you're logged into Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Awoodprofit.com">click here</a>.

Informative Resource: No matter how <a href="http://www.thehostplanet.com">cheap web hosting</a> you deal with, make sure that it offers <a href="http://www.asharedhosting.com">shared web hosting</a> and its <a href="http://www.hostqueue.com">web hosting services</a> are compatible with <a href="http://www.affiliateladder.net">affiliate marketing</a>. Only then purchasing a <a href="http://www.iseeq.co.uk/c/domain-registration.htm">domain name</a> on that <a href="http://www.iseeq.com/c/web-hosting.htm">hosting</a> service is worth all that moolah.
