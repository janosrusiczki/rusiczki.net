I've just uploaded <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janos/tags/20060910tttrc/">a bunch of photos</a> shot during the most enjoyable hike of the summer when we (je, Ioana and 2 friends who you'll see climbing) visited a nearby rock formation - the Rooster's Crest. Although it was already the first part of September we caught some great weather and had a great time.</p>
