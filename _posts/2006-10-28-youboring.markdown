<p>I wanted to put up a joke post a few days ago when YouTube was down for maintainance with something like: "Hey look, they're deleting yet more videos". But it turns out it wouldn't have been a joke at all as it looks like Google <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/10/27/comedy-central-yanks-clips-from-youtube/">pulled all the Comedy Central videos from YouTube</a>. That's right, acquire a service for an outrageous figure and then nicely delete everything that's good on it. I'm sure lots of people will come to watch how Johnny Nobody filmed his cat purring this morning or the next door emo kid's touching videoblog entry about his latest crush... And this is how good ol' fun YouTube turns into Google Videos which never really caught on even with their superior video quality. Well, guess why smartasses? Because it's boooring!!! Way to go Google. It looks like every move they make just makes YouTube and Napster's case look a lot more similar.</p>
