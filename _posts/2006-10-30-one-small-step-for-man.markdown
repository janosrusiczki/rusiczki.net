<p>Oh boy... Phew! For those of you who were holding their breaths after the suspenseful ending of <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2006/10/30/fingers_crossed">my last post</a> I have announcement to make: I have half of my driving license. Damn! When I left the room I thought that I messed up badly but after one and a half hour of gut wrenching horror I found out that I made 25 points out of 26. Wooow! Am I that good? Now with a bit of luck on Wednesday (the day of the driving test itself) I'm all ready to hunt innocent pedestrians. Keep those fingers crossed, they sure helped this time. :)</p>
