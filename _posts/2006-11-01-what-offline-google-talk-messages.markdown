<p>Wow, it's actually becoming usable. Well, that's a bit of an exaggerated statement because to be honest this was the only feature I was missing (badly). So now even if I shut down Yahoo! Messenger I can still sit around and waste time by chatting with my geek friends. And now I'll even receive stuff they sent me while I was taking care of, you know, my real life. Well, to be honest, at this moment I can't think of anything I'm missing from <a href="http://talk.google.com">Google Talk</a>. I like it a lot because it isn't overloaded with crap I won't ever use. Well, thumbs up Google, I hope you'll keep it this way.</p>
