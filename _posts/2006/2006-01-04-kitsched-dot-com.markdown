You can now go to <a href="http://www.kitsched.com">kitsched.com</a> and you'll be redirected to my blog's index page. You may ask: but why J&aacute;nos, why? Well, first of all Kitsched is a bit easier to remember than my last name and I just couldn't miss the $2.99 / year domain sale on <a href="http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Small Business</a>. By the way if you were thinking about getting yourself a domain but you just couldn't shell out the 10 bucks for it, now is the perfect time to act! Just think about it: with $10 you'll be able to secure your dream domain for 3 years or you'll be able to reserve 3 distinct domains (.com / .net / .org maybe?). Of course it is not mandatory to buy 3 domains... I was just making some silly comparisons to point out that regardless of the angle you're looking at it, this is an excelent deal.
