In fact it ended last Wednesday around noon but I had no time to post about it.

Long story short: after a near nervous breakdown on Tuesday generated by one Ultra PRO employe's promise that it'll be here that day and then the predictable disappointment of not arriving the panel finally got here on Wednesday. Only one week later than first promised. Not a bad performance, right? Not right! Not right at all! Ultra PRO sucks. Anyway, on with the story: I <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Other-VIDEO-Tools/Nokia-Monitor-Test.shtml">tested it</a> right there on the spot, after waiting more than half an hour for it to warm up a little, because when I arrived to the shop they just finished unloading it from the truck and there were around -10&deg;C outside. After witnessing it working perfectly with no dead pixels or any other problems whatsoever (touch wood) I took it home and since then I'm enjoying it. Fully.

I'm not too skilled when it comes to hardware reviews (for me it either works or doesn't) but there's one thing I can say about it: it's big. Even if the native resolution of 1280 x 1024 pixels is not that much it's a completely new feeling that I actually have to use my neck muscles and rotate my head when I want to follow an instant messenger window that I move from the upper right corner to the lower left corner of the screen. Movies and multimedia look great and even greater from a distance. My only problem and worry is that I'm abusing the joint that unites the stand and the panel itself. Each evening when we (Ioana and moi) sit down to watch our favourite shows I pull it forward to be clearly visible from the bed and then after we enjoy our <a href="http://www.tv.com/lost/show/24313/summary.html">Lost</a> / <a href="http://www.tv.com/scrubs/show/3613/summary.html">Scrubs</a> dose for the day I push it back to be visible again from the chair. I hope it will stand the wear and I won't be forced to superglue it or something... Touch wood again.

It's a shame but I haven't written one line of code on it yet. So I can't report anything about that aspect. But it should be at least OK. No games played either because I don't think that my feather light, no fat, ATI 9200 would be able to handle 1280 by 1024 in any modern games. However I used the TV card with my PlayStation plugged in and it looks cool. Haven't watched any real TV on it though. Yet. And because there's almost nothing worth watching on cable. And if it's worth watching the "great" reception quality would surely disappoint and turn me to the nearest BitTorrent tracker to fetch the very same show in HDTV quality. For evaluation purposes only obviously. Hehe.

And that concludes my "review" and as a final conclusion I can say that all in all, I'm very satisfied with it.
