As in Yet Another Birthday. It came and went as it always does and here I am one year older. If it's the number you're curious about, check out the <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/about/">about page</a> (at least my site will get some traffic you RSS freaks).

Actually the birthday itself was divided in two because Monday the 17th, the day itself, was Easter Monday - a holiday for me and so at the company I was celebrated on Friday. Oh, and this year I interrupted a kind of tradition as there was no miniparty (with pizza and drinks for everybody) at my place. I blame my budget. Which is on low side for the moment...

Anyway, here's the present list: a Philips hair trimmer from my work collegues and boss, a bottle of vine and a Kinder egg from the extended company members, a pair of comfortable shoes and a nice shirt from <a href="http://snowboard.colonies.com/members/ioana/">Ioana</a>, a shiny pillow from my Mum, some money from <a href="http://www.lucianmarin.ro">my partner in crime</a> and a <a href="http://www.beatport.com">BeatPort</a> giftcard from the <a href="http://www.infamous.ro">infamous</a> Seb which I yet have to spend. Plus many kind words from many other people either personally, by SMS or via Yahoo! Messenger. And I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for all those warm wishes. It felt really nice and in a way you made me forget how dangerously close I'm getting to that round number which starts with a 3...

Thanks.
