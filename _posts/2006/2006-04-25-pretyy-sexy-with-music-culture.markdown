Here's another fine tutorial and today's <a href="http://www.residentadvisor.net/forum_read.asp?ID=21415">topic</a> is: how to become the laughing stock of a respected dance music forum in a few easy steps. Performed by one of our fellow countrymen in the authentic Romanian way. Brainless Romanian way, I might add. Be sure to check out the second page of the topic because that's where it gets truly interesting... The real sad part is that he's actually representing a site or actually two because <a href="http://www.afterparty.ro" rel="nofollow">afterparty.ro</a> and <a href="http://www.djmag.ro" rel="nofollow">djmag.ro</a> seem to be clones of each other. Oh well, I guess this is the new generation of Romanian site owners...
