Yesterday, right after work I went up to Baia Sprie and after fetching some food I took a short walk in the woods on the hill above my house. The walk turned out truly refreshing, and check out what I saw. This is how the "Blue Lake" looked... You can guess once where it got it's name, but I swear I never saw it like this before. As much as I know the blue comes from the high sulfur content of the water, and I remember that as a kid I used to bathe there and whenever I had some sort of wound it would heal right after coming in contact with that water.

Silly me I forgot my GPS home. Next time you'll get some coordinates too... :-)

Back to work.
