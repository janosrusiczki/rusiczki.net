After wasting a few precious hours wading through forums and worthless shareware sites (all promoting the same 4 or 5 applications) I finally found the easiest method to convert VOBs recorded by a DVD camera into MPGs that are recognized by Ulead's Crap, uuuhm, I mean, <a href="http://www.ulead.com/dws/runme.htm">DVD Workshop</a>. And the solution is, ladies and gentlemen: changing the damn file extensions! The funniest aspect of all this hustle is that the aforementioned Ulead app recognized and imported 4 (mini)DVDs almost instantly but it had something personal with the 5th one because I couldn't import it no matter how I tried... Oh well, I'm glad I solved the problem.
