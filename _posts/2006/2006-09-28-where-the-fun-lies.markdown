<a href="http://www.fabrica.it/blog/techno_tuesday/">Techno Tuesday on the Fabrica Blog.</a> Warning! High geekness level required to understand all the jokes. Hmmm, I sure had a lot of fun even if I missed the meaning of one or two. And I'll subscribe right now. To the RSS feed. In my <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">web based newsreader</a>. And I need an iPod. Oh, yeah.
