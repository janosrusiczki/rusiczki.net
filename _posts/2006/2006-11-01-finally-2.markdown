I succeeded. I took my driver's license today! (Insert applause here.) And it was about time considering that I started the school sometime in the second half of August. I still can't believe it's over! It looks like all that stress was worth it after all, as today I can proudly declare that I'm a fully licensed driver. And now for some celebration... :-) And take care on the streets while in Baia Mare... >:-)
