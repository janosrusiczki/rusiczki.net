Pro TV revisits the "set" of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443453/">Borat</a>, a poor village in Dambovita county. Hilarity ensues. Again. Check out the <a href="http://www.protv.ro/stiri/divertisment/pitoresc-si-controversat-borat-un-film-turnat-partial-in-romania.html">news piece</a> and the <a href="http://www.protv.ro/stiri/divertisment/top-story-imagini-in-exclusivitate-cu-figurantii-din-blockbuster.html">unedited web exclusives</a>. Of course, knowing Romanian will help a lot... :-)

<b>Update:</b> <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061114/ap_en_ot/romania_borat_backlash">The plot thickens.</a> If until now nobody knew where it was filmed, well, we're starting to make a name for ourselves. It's like sending out the following message: Liked what you saw in Borat? Come to Romania!
