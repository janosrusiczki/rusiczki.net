<p>Reading the first blog entries I wrote back in 2001 (wow, it really seems that was centuries ago) I realized that my English level was basically the same back then as it is now. And that brought up the question: what now? Should I take some advanced English courses or should I improve my miserable French? I guess I'll go with option B.<br />
<strong>Bonus!</strong> My first blog entries - <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rusiczkij/2001_07_29_blog_archive.html">one</a>, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rusiczkij/2001_08_12_blog_archive.html">two</a>, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rusiczkij/2001_08_19_blog_archive.html">three</a>, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rusiczkij/2001_10_28_blog_archive.html">four</a>, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rusiczkij/2001_11_25_blog_archive.html">five</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rusiczkij/2002_03_10_blog_archive.html">six</a>.</p>
