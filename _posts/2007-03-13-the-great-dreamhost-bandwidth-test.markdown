My <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2007/03/13/o_rly">last post</a> is kind of an experiment as that one image made an absolutely huge traffic back on <a href="http://deea.supermagnet.ro">Deea's blog</a> before we took it down in a hurry fearing the huge extra bandwidth usage bill from <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net">Media Temple</a> that never came... But as <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">DreamHost</a> is offering more bandwidth than I could ever consume along with weird outages (like the one I had yesterday) I thought I'll give them a run for their money as kind of a revenge. However it might not be so successful this time because when Deea posted it that owl was all the rage on the Internets and besides it somehow got a great score from Google as it was showing up around the 3rd place in their image search for "o rly". Hmmm, I guess we'll live and see.
