<p>I had an idea and I took a bunch of pictures on my way to work. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janos/sets/72157601092213316/detail/">Here's the result.</a> Don't expect anything artsy. What you should expect is a virtual walk through Baia Mare. Just like being there.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, I'm trying to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/baia-mare/discuss/72157600865421799/">organize</a> a meeting for Flickr users from Baia Mare. Looks like it'll happen sometime during the next weekend. Check it out and if you're interested, join us.</p>
