<p>Cristi Mezei (who's domain seems to have expired) sent me an IM notice yesterday containing some <a href="http://forum.seopedia.ro/bar-lobby/5506-withdraw-si-receive-payments-paypal-acum-si-la-noi.html" title="In Romanian">great news</a>, namely that one can now receive and withdraw payments to / from a PayPal account opened from Romania. Withdrawal only works with US bank accounts however you can also withdraw money to your (Romanian) debit / credit card for a flat fee of 2 Euros (if I remember correctly).</p>
<p>This is excellent news for all the Romanian freelancers out there who wish to carve themselves a living working for clients abroad and who, until now, were limited to "complicated" Western Union payments and such. Well, not anymore.</p>
<p>So, go ahead boys and girls, earn some honest money.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> It is confirmed, at least the receiving part, I just got 2 Euros as a test from a friend. I'm rich!</p>
