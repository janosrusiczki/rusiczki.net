As an update to <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2007/01/24/speeed/">yesterday's entry</a>, I should report that it looks like the speed is stable. And that means that I'm really getting what I've been paying for since half a year or so. My CableLink connection really works at 1 Mbps as advertised. And this makes me ("<a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2002/12/27/the-end-of-broadband/">Mr. Downloader</a>") extremely happy! Finally I have the Internet at my fingertips. Hehehe! :-) Welcome real broadband!
