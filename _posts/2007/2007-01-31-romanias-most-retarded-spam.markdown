I wanted to post about this at one time and then forgot all about it, but it looks like it's too late now as Marius <a href="http://www.pahomi.ro/?p=180" title="[Romanian]">beat me to it</a>. And what's more, he offers an in depth analysis of the whole... CRAP. Word of advice: if you know what IQ means don't ever open an envelope that has Reader's Digest printed on it. Your head might explode.
