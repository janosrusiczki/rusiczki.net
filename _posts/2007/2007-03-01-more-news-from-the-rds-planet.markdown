It looks like upload is now 512 kbps. That's double the old limit of 256 kbps. A much welcomed change as I don't have to wait AGES to send something to somebody or to upload a site or whatnot. Wow, I can't believe it but I couldn't really complain about anything concerning <a href="http://www.rdslink.ro">RDS's</a> service lately. Actually I'm stating here and now that I'm more than satisfied. Touch wood.
