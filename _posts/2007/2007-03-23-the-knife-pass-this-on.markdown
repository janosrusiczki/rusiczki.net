If you're a reader of this blog you might have noticed that I'm not the one to post copy-paste videos. But when I happen to stumble upon something this cool I just can't help myself. As a side note: this is the only video in which [the brother and sister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Knife) show their faces, Olof being the guy in the blue jacket who starts dancing first and Karin the girl who stares at the end of the video.
