If you're a reader of this blog you might have noticed that I'm not the one to post copy-paste videos. But when I happen to stumble upon something this cool I just can't help myself. As a side note: this is the only video in which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Knife">the brother and sister</a> show their faces, Olof being the guy in the blue jacket who starts dancing first and Karin the girl with who stares at the end of the video.
