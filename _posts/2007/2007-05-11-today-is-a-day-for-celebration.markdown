[Paypal](http://www.paypal.com) is [finally available in Romania](http://www.seopedia.org/seo-news/paypal-for-romania-now-available-send-only/). While this is great news for all those wannabe eBay users, those who wanted a Pro account on Flickr and many others, there's a down side:

> PayPal accounts opened in this country or region currently cannot withdraw funds. We regret any inconvenience this may cause you.

So, at least for the moment, to receive money I'll stick with [Moneybookers](https://www.moneybookers.com/app/?rid=618519).
