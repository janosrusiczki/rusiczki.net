<a href="http://www.paypal.com">Paypal</a> is <a href="http://www.seopedia.org/seo-news/paypal-for-romania-now-available-send-only/">finally available in Romania</a>.

While this is great news for all those wannabe eBay users, those who wanted a Pro account on Flickr and many others, there's a down side:

<blockquote>PayPal accounts opened in this country or region currently cannot withdraw funds. We regret any inconvenience this may cause you.</p></blockquote>
So, at least for the moment, to receive money I'll stick with <a href="https://www.moneybookers.com/app/?rid=618519">Moneybookers</a>.
