I'm afraid to embed because as we all know video sites passionately delete music videos but you can search <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/videos/relevance/search/simian+mobile+disco">Daily Motion</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=simian+mobile+disco">YouTube</a> or even <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=simian+mobile+disco+i+believe+video">the big G</a> for Simian Mobile Disco's song "I believe". And I happen to think that the song rocks and the video is - hold on to your pants - awesome! Get your guns out, hehehe.
