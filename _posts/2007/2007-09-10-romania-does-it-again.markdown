Just read this on <a href="http://www.cianblog.com/">Lucian Savluc's blog</a>:

<blockquote>I just found from one of the ROSI members (<a href="http://www.rolix.org/">Laurentiu Buzdugan</a>), that Romanian Standard Association (<a href="http://www.asro.ro/">ASRO</a>) was one of the few countries representatives who <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070904082606181">approved without any comments</a> the Microsoft OOXML proposal! (For those who are not familiar with it, there is a quite straight forward explanation on Wikipedia about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOXML">OOXML</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">ODF</a>.) Can you imagine? No comments or nothing, they just say “OK, we totally agree with Office Open XML”!</p></blockquote>
This is nothing short of disgusting... In a world where countries straight out refuse the format because, well, it's <b>REDUNDANT</b> to say the least, Romania just accepts it without any comments. I don't even think they studied what it is or anything, they saw Microsoft written on it and they accepted. What do you mean, why!? Because it's Microsoft, stupid!

Well, I'm pretty sure nothing can be done for Romania to unswallow MS's (no bad words today) but FYI here's the banner linking to the 6 unanswered questions on MS OOXML asked by the <a href="http://fsfeurope.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>:

Read and judge for yourself.
