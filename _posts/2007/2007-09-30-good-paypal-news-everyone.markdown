Cristi Mezei (who's domain seems to have expired) sent me an IM notice yesterday containing some <a href="http://forum.seopedia.ro/bar-lobby/5506-withdraw-si-receive-payments-paypal-acum-si-la-noi.html" title="In Romanian">great news</a>, namely that one can now receive and withdraw payments to / from a PayPal account opened from Romania. Withdrawal only works with US bank accounts however you can also withdraw money to your (Romanian) debit / credit card for a flat fee of 2 Euros (if I remember correctly).

This is excellent news for all the Romanian freelancers out there who wish to carve themselves a living working for clients abroad and who, until now, were limited to "complicated" Western Union payments and such. Well, not anymore.

So, go ahead boys and girls, earn some honest money.

<strong>Update:</strong> It is confirmed, at least the receiving part, I just got 2 Euros as a test from a friend. I'm rich!
