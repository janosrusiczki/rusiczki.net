Hopefully this will be the first of a series written by a recent switcher... :)

I've installed the Perian extension for movies right after I reinstalled OSX but the sound was desynchronized in several movies so I got rid of it pretty fast and installed good ol' <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> instead. In case of problems there's one more alternative on the list, <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">MPlayer</a>, but for the moment VLC works flawlessly so there's no reason for another change. I'm missing the sweet QT Player interface, but oh well.

<a href="http://pax.mioritics.ro/">Alex</a> pointed me to an awesome site: <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/">iusethis</a> which let's you specify the applications you use and shows you "neighbors" which are users with the same preferences as yours (&agrave; la <a href="http://www.last.fm">last.fm</a>). You can take a peek and see what else they're using but there's also a most used applications section which comes in extremely handy for a newborn Mac user. Like <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/user/kitsched">me</a>.

To be continued.
