Oh come on, update those databases already! I've been seeing this for months since my provider changed my IP. Since then, according to this widget I keep bumping into on tons of MySpace profiles and some blogs, I've moved to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Tom%C3%A9_and_Pr%C3%ADncipe">S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe</a> (or at least that's what I think it shows me). Well, it's probably nice and warm down there but the truth is, I'm still in good ol' Baia Mare, Romania.
