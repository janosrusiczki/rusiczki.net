<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/87848449@N00/sets/72157603028846716/detail/">Some recent photos from Cavnic.</a> Let's hope it'll last through the weekend. It'll be the first time our C3 will transport the boards and since we didn't yet had the money to get a proper snowboard rack over the car we'll just stuff them inside. Good bye rear seats - hello 2 person car. Anyway, it's looking good and we'll sure have a healthy dose of fun.
