I'm on a blogging frenzy! But I'm fed up with Movable Type's sluggishness...

And I know without any shadow of doubt that the culprit is not MT, but Dreamhost and their hosting which is anything but dreamy. Nightmarish maybe, but not dreamy. So I have decided to move back to <a href="http://totalchoicehosting.com/">TotalChoice Hosting</a> as soon as they sort out a PayPal payment issue I just reported after being unable to apply.

If this blog becomes inaccessible during the following days it means that I'm changing nameservers and I'm on my way out of this <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">crap</a>. At least with this site.
