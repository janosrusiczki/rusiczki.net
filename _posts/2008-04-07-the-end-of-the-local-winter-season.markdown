Depressing.<br />
It looks that I was right when I titled the Flickr set containing pictures from last week's Saturday snowboarding session as "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janos/sets/72157604301704587/">Winter season's end (2008)</a>". It was a beautiful day with full on sunshine. Actually the sun was shining so brightly that I was concerned about the bald spot on the top of my head getting burnt. I've also had one of this winter's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janos/2371573424/">best backcountry runs</a> just a few short meters from the "official" Roata slope. Mmm, sweet powder. It felt great...<br />
Unfortunately the rains that kept falling during most of last week proved to be a real nemesis of the remaining snow. I checked the webcam this Saturday too. It was pouring. The cable transport was off. There was noone. Sad.<br />
Anyway, I said the end of the <em>local</em> winter season because starting with Thursday we're hitting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A2lea_Lake">Balea Lake</a> for a grand season end. Keeping my fingers crossed for some good weather.</p>
