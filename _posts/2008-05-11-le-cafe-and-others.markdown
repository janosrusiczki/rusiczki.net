Plus <a href="http://www3.france-jeunes.net/paroles-oldelaf.et.mr.d-le.cafe-42495.htm">lyrics</a> for those (like me) who understand written French better.<br />
Friday evening after a reminder and invitation from a friend we went and attended '<a href="http://trescourt.com">Tr&egrave;s Court</a>', a short film festival. "Movies" of up to 3 minutes (titles and credits did not count) were presented, most of them funny and some weird and / or artsy. The one above was probably my favorite of the 51 even though I voted for another clip in the respective section. The fest in it's whole was a lot of fun.<br />
Here are some more favorite shorts I found over the Net: <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/armz/video/x4ghrk_duel_shortfilms">Duel</a> by Antoine Revel-Mouroz, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS4wG904xBw">Things fall apart</a> by R. Chiu / C. Hewitt (impressive sound design), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPm0CGc7sX4">My Mum the Wrestler</a> by Mark Withers, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0ffwDYo00Q">Cat man do</a> by Simon Tofield, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9MgpT-8pHk">Butterfly</a> by St&eacute;phane Levallois (very very nice) and <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4a34u_flash_shortfilms">Flash</a> by Marco Cohen. Enjoy them while you can (until the video sites decide to pull them, that is).</p>
