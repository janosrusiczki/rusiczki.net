So, today is the big day! The day we'll hopefully set a record...

Keep your eyes peeled at the <a href="http://getfirefox.com">getfirefox.com</a> page. And while waiting for the great download frenzy to start go <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/">pledge</a> if you haven't already.

I feel that Firefox 3 will be a huge improvement. <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2008/04/04/firefox_3">I've blogged about it</a> back in April and I've been using it since on my Windows machine at home. It never crashed and the speed improvement over Firefox 2 is really impressive. So I'm one satisfied customer. Now please, I can haz <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> for it?
