<p>Long story short: I moved a high traffic forum to my (ex-)server and it sort of crumbled under the load. Not once but twice. After the second manual reboot request I just deactivated the forum and drew the conclusion that it was time to upgrade. I had to do it fast, because said forum is my main AdSense cash cow and it meant that any downtime meant income = 0  and I just couldn't let that happen. So the upgrade happened yesterday night.</p>
<p>From this:</p>

<p>To this:</p>
<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="new-server.png" src="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/new-server.png" width="371" height="87" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></span></p>
<p>For just $30 per month more... I'd say it's worth it! I don't want to sound like a <a href="http://www.theplanet.com">Planet</a> fanboy but their <a href="http://www.theplanet.com/dedicated-servers/server-specials/">server specials</a> are just awesomely priced. Plus I've got the setup waived after speaking with a support person cause my card didn't went through at first.</p>
<p>Well, that's the news.</p>
