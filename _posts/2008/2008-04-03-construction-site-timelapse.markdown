My video. Let me show you it. OK, lolcat language over. :-)

First of all I hope my boss won't spank me for revealing sensitive company stuff. As all you see above is happening behind a high fence.

And now for some technical info: the movie was created with <a href="http://www.ndrw.co.uk/">JPGAvi</a> (an unregistered version of this software, actually) and it is made up of 899 frames which translate into an equal number of images captured by a <a href="http://www.mobotix.com/other/products/m22m_camera_series">Mobotix M22M</a> surveillance camera from one of our own construction sites. The images were captured at one minute intervals from 6:00 AM to 8:59 PM on March 27, 2008 - the day that began as winter and ended as spring. 15 hours x 60 frames / hour = 900 frames. My only credit besides assembling the video is that it was me who set up the camera's operating system to save these snapshots to one of my own FTP accounts.

Well, that's about it. I really like how the clip turned out. Enjoy!
