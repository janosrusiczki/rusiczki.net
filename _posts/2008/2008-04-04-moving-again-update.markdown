A follow up to <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2008/04/04/moving-again/">my last entry</a>: I made the payment over at TotalChoice and I changed the nameservers to point to the new host. The DNS propagation waiting game begins... Funnily now that I'm in the process of moving the whole thing started working a lot quicker than it did yesterday. It might have something to do with the fact that it's the middle of the night over in the US or because Murphy's laws are valid in webhosting too.
