Got so much stuff to blog about but my energy level is painfully low...

Just wanted to note that I was getting tired of all the spam comment notifications that were landing in my mailbox so I installed <a href="http://appnel.com/kb/mtakismet/mtakismet-manual">MT-Akismet</a>. For the time being, the comments will remain moderated but if the plug-in performs well, I'll open them again.

I'll be back after some well earned sleep.
