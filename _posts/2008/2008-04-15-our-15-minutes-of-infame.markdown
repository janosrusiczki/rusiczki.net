<a href="http://www.jurnalul.ro/articole/122421/%CEn-aceeasi-zi-am-scapat-de-doua-ori-de-moarte">Romanian knowledge is a must.</a> Full of incorrect info and made up quotes, but, well, we're in the newspaper. Joy! Here's <a href="https://content.rusiczki.net/blogpics/our_15_minutes_of_infame_screenshot.png">a screenshot of the article</a> for eternity.

<strong>Update:</strong> The three photos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ioana/">Ioana</a> took right after the event: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ioana/2414483102/">one</a> - I'm recovering her snowboard (it's the photo that illustrates this entry), <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ioana/2413659357/">two</a> - the lower part of the avalanche and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ioana/2413660949/">three</a> - where it all came from. All three photos worth to be checked out in their original size. You'll need a Flickr account for that.
