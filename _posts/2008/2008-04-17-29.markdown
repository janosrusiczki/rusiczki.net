No. This isn't entry number 29. Neither is the 29th day. Not even 29 months.

It's 29 years. Since I'm on this planet.

Yey. Happy birthday to me!

<strong>Update:</strong> The Mac-Forums <a href="https://content.rusiczki.net/blogpics/mac-forums-multiple-birthday-wish.php" onclick="window.open('http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/mac-forums-multiple-birthday-wish.php','popup','width=500,height=143,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">made sure</a> I get their wishes. Btw, it's kind of depressing to get the same greeting from tens of <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com">vBulletin</a> based forums the only thing changing being the forum's name and occasionally the username.
