Hey, look <a href="http://www.centraleuroperally.com/">what</a> we had in Baia Mare. Or around Baia Mare. The Dakar Rally gang racing around... Did anyone knew about it? No. No media attention. Why? Because it was organized by Hungarians, it was held in Maramures (what, that county in the North-West?) and it didn't involve Becali. Fuck this country.
