Album of the week even.

<a href="http://www.portishead.co.uk/">Portishead</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_%28Portishead_album%29">Third</a>.

You can <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/portishead/third?autostart=1">stream</a> the whole album for free on last.fm. Yeeey. I'm in the process of listening to it for the first time and I definitely like what I'm hearing. A lot.

Official release: April 28, 2008. Hmmm, might even order it as a CD.

<strong>Update:</strong> It seems that I've caught what were the last hours of the full streaming album. All you can listen now are 30 second samples. Too bad.
