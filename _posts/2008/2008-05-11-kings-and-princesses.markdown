I must confess. I'm among the growing fan base of <a href="http://pitzipoanca.org/">pitzipoanca.org</a> and <a href="http://cocalari.com/">cocalari.com</a>. Emphasis on the first one (I've been genuinely sad when the blog got disabled on wordpress.com - hurray for the return on their own domain). Human stupidity and bad taste at their max can be a good source of daily laughs. Even if they more or less directly affect us. Discovered via the almighty <a href="http://zoso.ro">zoso</a>.
