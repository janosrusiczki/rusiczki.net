Eff the match between Romania and France!

It's <a href="http://www.macrumorslive.com/">liveblog</a> refreshing time tonight at 20:00 PM EET when Steve will get on the stage and announce the toys that will get tons of people excited in the coming months. Hey, what am I talking about? Everyone's already excited to max. I'm not so keen on the main news as I'm not an iPhone owner and I don't even want one (this will instantly change the moment <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> will include a detailed routable map of Romania) but I'm sure there'll be other news too. And to be honest I'm geek enough to find the whole thing entertaining and I do get a kick out of finding out about the stuff as it happens.

In completely unrelated news I remembered about <a href="http://www.getacoder.com/projects/need_operating_system_42879.html">this "project"</a> these days and it provided me with a healthy dose of smile again. Actually not the project announcement itself, but some comments are killers. I even made a screenshot and I <a href="https://content.rusiczki.net/blogpics/need-operating-system.png">archived it</a> for ethernity. Via <a href="http://digg.com/software/This_guy_needs_an_operating_system_coded">Digg</a>.
