Long story short: I moved a high traffic forum to my (ex-)server and it sort of crumbled under the load. Not once but twice. After the second manual reboot request I just deactivated the forum and drew the conclusion that it was time to upgrade. I had to do it fast, because said forum is my main AdSense cash cow and it meant that any downtime meant income = 0  and I just couldn't let that happen. So the upgrade happened yesterday night.

From this:

To this:

For just $30 per month more... I'd say it's worth it! I don't want to sound like a [Planet](http://www.theplanet.com) fanboy but their [server specials](http://www.theplanet.com/dedicated-servers/server-specials/) are just awesomely priced. Plus I've got the setup waived after speaking with a support person cause my card didn't went through at first.

Well, that's the news.
