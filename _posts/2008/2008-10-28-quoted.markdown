Wow, I'm such a web celebrity! Look, I'm quoted on the main page of <a href="http://www.pixlr.com">Pixlr</a>:

<img alt="Screenshot of my quote on Pixlr" src="https://content.rusiczki.net/blogpics/pixlr-screenshot-quoted.png" width="500" height="66" class="image"/>

Here's the <a href="https://content.rusiczki.net/blogpics/pixlr-screenshot-full.png">full screenshot</a>. As much as I remember I left the said comment on some blog around the web (can't remember exactly which one, I just checked <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com">Download Squad</a> and it looks like it's not that) and it seems like I struck a cord with the guys. Well, I'm glad I created a warm fuzzy feeling for someone, even if when it comes to web based image editors I'm a <a href="http://www.piknic.com">Picnik</a> user as it has all the tools I need plus it's integrated with <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>.

Thanks for the find Moebius.
