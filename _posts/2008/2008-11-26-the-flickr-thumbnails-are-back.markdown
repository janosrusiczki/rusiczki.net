I mean, they're finally updated to the current status of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janos/">my Flickr photostream</a>. They've been stuck with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janos/sets/72157604552750718/">some photos</a> shot during our visit to Sibiu for more than half a year now so it was about time that I unstuck them. The truth is that I lost the thumbnail importer tool the moment I changed servers and abandoned <a href="http://dreamhost.com">NightmareHost</a> for my own private server on <a href="http://theplanet.com">The Planet</a> and only now I found them, while doing some spr... uuuh, winter cleaning on my hard drive at work.

In other news, <a href="http://www.drumandbass.ro">drumandbass.ro</a> is <a href="http://beta.drumandbass.ro">almost reborn</a>! :)
