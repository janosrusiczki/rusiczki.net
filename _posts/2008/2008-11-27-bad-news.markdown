I just received some bad news from home: Bodri, [the one](https://www.rusiczki.net/2004/04/24/one-funny-photo/) who's been driving traffic to this site from the Google image search results for "funny dog", long before [lolcats](http://www.icanhascheezburger.com/) and [loldogs](http://www.ihasahotdog.com) became the craze passed away. Although he was kept on a leash as a guard dog he was an extremely active and fun creature, always ready to show some love, even if I have moved from home long ago. And it's very strange because just Sunday night when I helped my father move some things around the house, he was running circles annoying us... Well, may he chase the chickens (his favorite activity) in a happier place.
