The title is obviously a pun, as <em>someone</em> is so obsessed with SEO... :-)

I helped my friend <a href="http://www.lucianmarin.ro">Luci</a> with his site's redesign. As in XHTML & CSS by your's truly. It was a simple and pleasant job, unfortunately interrupted several times by <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2009/01/26/a-bitter-update/">my recent problems</a> and inherent laziness. But the good news is that it's ready now. At least the homepage...

Tatadaaam!

Clicking on the image above will take you to his site. Plus I have <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/lucian-marin-website-screenshot.png">the full version</a> of the above screenshot archived for eternity, so we'll always know how the site looked on January the 30th, 2009.

PS. Resize those damn goodies images!
