<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-734" title="Webcam image of the Suior slope on March the 20th, 2009" src="http://www.rusiczki.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/webcam-suior-2009-03-20.jpg" alt="Webcam image of the Suiors slope on March the 20th, 2009" width="500" height="385" />

Yeah, I know winter just left and it's too early to get nostalgic about it but I had this photo laying around on my desktop and thought it would be cool to archive it somewhere. The original file name was "suior-de-vis" which means, for all of the 2 English readers of this blog, "dreamy-suior". Suior being the name of the slope.

And yes, you are right, I'm stalking Jurnalul National's webcams <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2009/04/07/yep-its-over/">quite</a> a <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2009/04/09/free-gigi/">lot</a>. Because they're awesome, mostly in the winter.
