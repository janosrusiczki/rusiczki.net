<p>Mark the date of April the 9th, 2009. It was the day I first helped Amazon sell a book. I would have blogged earlier about this, but I only checked my Amazon Associates account yesterday night...</p>
<p>You might have noticed that since I relaunched this blog the <a href="http://www.adsense.com">AdSense</a> ads disappeared although, truth to be told, I was making a few precious cents daily while they were up. However, after a sudden hunch I went to <a href="http://associates.amazon.co.uk">Amazon's Associates Central</a> and created myself a few manually targeted product referrals for two of my most popular posts: <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2008/04/14/nikon-d60-users-manual-pdf/">the one with the Nikon D60 PDF manual</a> and <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2007/01/24/sql-dump-file-splitter/">the one with the MySQL splitter download</a> (referrals at the bottom of the posts, they're hard to miss actually). And what do you know, someone bought <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0470385383?ie=UTF8&tag=kits-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0470385383">Nikon D60 for Dummies</a> via my referral link!</p>
<p>Although the aforementioned two posts are my most hit-n-run'd pages (visitors pop in from Google, grab what they want and off they go) and so it's unlikely that the buyer will be reading this post, I'll still take a shot in the dark and send out a huge <strong>THANK YOU</strong> to whoever you are! :-)</p>
