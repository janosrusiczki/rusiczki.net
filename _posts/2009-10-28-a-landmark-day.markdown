I'm talking about yesterday. I have two reasons to say it was an important day:

1. Yahoo mercilessly killed Geocities with <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rusiczkij/index-old.html">my first ever website</a> on it. No way to easily backup my stuff (as in download an archive with everything) but at least I managed to grab a few screenshots (<a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/my-first-website-01.png">1</a>, <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/my-first-website-02.png">2</a>, <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/my-first-website-03.png">3</a>, <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/my-first-website-04.png">4</a>, <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/my-first-website-05.png">5</a> and <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/my-first-website-06.png">6</a>) - too bad none of my screen grabbing software manages frames well. Unfortunately there's not much on archive.org either.

2. I upgraded <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2004/04/23/oh-i-hate-this-country/">my ancient Orange service plan</a> that had 180 Orange and 25 national minutes to a brand new one called Delfin 8 - which is cheaper than what I had and has (hold on to something) 700 Orange minutes and 125 national ones. I could have gone for a cheaper plan as I'll never talk that much, but it's also nice to have the peace of mind that I can if I want to. All this upgrade happened after I called customer service because I wasn't able to confirm my payment. Me the phone power user. Not.
