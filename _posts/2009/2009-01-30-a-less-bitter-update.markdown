My mum is getting better. Slowly, with baby steps, but she's getting better.

After on Tuesday evening I cried while visiting her because she started talking weird once again and my father was complaining that she doesn't want to eat and cooperate with the therapist, the day before yesterday my father called me and I could hear the smile in his voice when he said: "wait, your mother will come to the phone and talk with you". And I could hear the change in her voice and it was nothing short of miraculous. From one day to another she went from crazy talk to normal talk and she said she's very happy with the therapist, and that she's very glad that she's being helped and put back on her feet. Finally some good news!

Yesterday evening I visited them and indeed she was much better. Which in turn made me feel much better.
