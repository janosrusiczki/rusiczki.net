Don't mind me please while I try out some stuff.

I briefly installed the <a href="http://intensedebate.com/">IntenseDebate</a> comment enhancer plug-in only to realize that while I liked the added functionality of threaded comments and the whole shebang of other functionality it brought along, I strongly disliked the fact that from the <a href="http://www.google.com">almighty G</a>'s point of view the comments were not on my blog's pages. So I uninstalled it to find that the two test comments I added while the plug-in was installed were stored in my local database too. Very nice and userfriendly touch, not the usual lock-in you find around the web. So, the fancy IntenseDebate got replaced with the much simpler <a href="http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/">Subscribe to Comments plug-in</a>, which, while age old, does its job admirably well.

There won't be any future <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2009/04/06/twitter-weekly-updates-for-2009-04-06/">Twitter digest posts</a> either. If you wish to see my Twitter activity take a look at the right sidebar, or even better, go to <a href="http://twitter.com/kitsched">Twitter</a>.

<a href="http://recaptcha.net/">reCAPTCHA</a> showed up again. Why was it needed when I have Akismet activated anyway? Well, I don't like my spam counter rising - even if every spam gets moderated. It takes a human only 5 additional seconds to solve a CAPTCHA and I haven't seen one (ONE!) comment spam come through while using reCAPTCHA on the old version of the blog. So I gather that bots are having a real hard time with it.

Oh, and the blog has a logo now. Thanks <a href="http://www.adnan.ro">Alin</a>!
