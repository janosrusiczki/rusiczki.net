It looks like when [I moved everything to the root of the site](http://www.rusiczki.net/2009/04/05/heading-into-the-straight-line/) and created the redirects I forgot an essential one: the FEED!

Today I checked my [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com) account, which by the way is badly messed up since Google half transitioned it, and I noticed that around April the 6th my stats dropped. Upon checking my vanity subscription in Google Reader I noticed that it was stuck at the '[Goodbye MySpace account](http://www.rusiczki.net/2009/04/02/goodbye-myspace-account/)' post which I made just before the transition - and the error message was complaining about not being able to find /blog/index.xml.

WHOOPS!!! I quickly fixed it (created a redirect) and hopefully no one got scared by the avalanche of posts that happened this afternoon. :-)

**Edit:** Additionally [twitterfeed.com](http://twitterfeed.com/) was messed up and that's why the blog post announcements doubled on [twitter](http://twitter.com). It's too long and technical to explain what was wrong but the important thing is that it's fixed now.
