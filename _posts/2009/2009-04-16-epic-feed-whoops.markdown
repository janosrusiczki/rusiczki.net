It looks like when <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2009/04/05/heading-into-the-straight-line/">I moved everything to the root of the site</a> and created the redirects I forgot an essential one: the FEED!

Today I checked my <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a> account, which by the way is badly messed up since Google half transitioned it, and I noticed that around April the 6th my stats dropped. Upon checking my vanity subscription in Google Reader I noticed that it was stuck at the '<a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2009/04/02/goodbye-myspace-account/">Goodbye MySpace account</a>' post which I made just before the transition - and the error message was complaining about not being able to find /blog/index.xml.

WHOOPS!!! I quickly fixed it (created a redirect) and hopefully no one got scared by the avalanche of posts that happened this afternoon. :-)

<strong>Edit:</strong> Additionally <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">twitterfeed.com</a> was messed up and that's why the blog post announcements doubled on <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>. It's too long and technical to explain what was wrong but the important thing is that it's fixed now.
