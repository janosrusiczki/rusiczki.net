I'll post this here because this blog is less volatile than Twitter:

I fucking hate working with Template Monster templates. To characterize them as lousy would be a huge understatement. I'm imagining the so called "designers" as they throw element after element on the page pretty much freestyle without caring about pixel size, spacing or other stupid things like this. Why should they, after all? Let the poor web developer slap himself when he's on the job and the client expects the work to be done.

That's what I'm doing now...
