<p>I just uninstalled Winamp.</p>
<p>I've been a Winamp user since the autumn of 1998 when I got my first computer but I used it even before that on various friends' computers. <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2003/10/21/winamp-5-rocks/">Look</a> how enthusiast I was when Winamp 5 came out back in 2003 after the mess that Winamp 3 turned out to be. However, I had enough. Now when I uninstalled it with <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html">Revo Uninstaller</a> I noticed that it left behind not less than 1500 registry entries - which were subsequently deleted - I haven't even checked the directory size but I guess that I can safely say that 1500 leftover registry entries is bloat. Plus it always insisted on updating and installing stuff I never needed - toolbars, bundled software, you name it. Yep, pure bloatware.</p>
<p>I've been having an affair with <a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/">foobar2000</a> at my last job, mostly because I had a less powerful computer over there and Winamp was eating up too much of its resources. And now that affair turns into a full blown relationship because as of today foobar2000 becomes my main media player.</p>
