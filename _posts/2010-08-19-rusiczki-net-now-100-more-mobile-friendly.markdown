<p>Oh yeah, since last Friday I'm a proud smartphone owner. You might even ask what took me so long and you'd be quite right. Well, I considered that I don't really need a smartphone since 80% of the day I'm sitting in front of the computer but I sort of got the gadget lust after <a href="http://www.flickr.com/ioana">Ioana</a> bought herself a <a href="http://galaxys.samsungmobile.com">Samsung Galaxy S</a>. She got hers on Tuesday and Friday I had mine. Go figure... I just sat there Thursday night and decided it's way too nice and good value for the money and that I need one.</p>
<p>Since then I've been playing with it constantly, installing and trying out apps, browsing and checking out everything. Proper gadget fever, I haz it.</p>
<p>While browsing around I noticed that some blogs display truly nicely and well optimized for mobile reading. Half of these sites were hosted on Tumblr which seems to auto apply a mobile optimized theme whenever you visit using a mobile browser, and the other half were Wordpress powered blogs using the <a href="http://www.wptouch.com/">wptouch</a> plugin / theme.</p>
<p>So I went ahead and installed the same plugin here on my blog so you'll be able to enjoy the two posts I'll post this year from your mobile.</p>
<p>And, to be really stylish I posted this present entry using the official Wordpress app for Android.</p>
