For the few of you that haven't been spammed with this the last two days via Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and my Messenger status, here's Ioana and me riding the nearby slope of Suior by night.

<object width="500" height="300"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/xTehe6NKE9I&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6&hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/xTehe6NKE9I&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x2b405b&color2=0x6b8ab6&hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="500" height="300"></embed></object>

This was the first real test of the gadget I got for Ioana's birthday (but for myself too, to be honest), a GoPro HD helmet cam.
