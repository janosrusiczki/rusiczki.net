Friday afternoon I received an invite to try out the beta version of <a href="http://www.postmarkapp.com">Postmark</a>, a transactional e-mail delivery service from <a href="http://wildbit.com/">Wildbit</a>, the guys and gals who made <a href="http://www.beanstalkapp.com">Beanstalk</a> and <a href="http://www.newsberry.com">Newsberry</a>. What are transactional e-mails, you might ask? The answer is: e-mails generated by a web application after an user action such as registration, requesting a password reminder, receiving a reply to a comment, etc. The problem me and many developers faced is that sometimes the client's servers are blacklisted and these e-mails land in the users' spam folder. This is where Postmark comes to the rescue, hopefully - instead of using the built in mail function of your web development language of choice you issue a call to Postmark which sends out the e-mail from their "well regarded" servers so that hopefully they land in the user's inbox.

To give something back, I've put together a <a href="http://codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter</a> library for this service. This grants easy integration of Postmark with your CodeIgniter web app: you upload two files, fill in your API key then include the library where needed and send mails away.

<h3>Download & credits</h3>
The best fork of this library is this one: <a href="https://github.com/zackkitzmiller/postmark-codeigniter">zackkitzmiller/postmark-codeigniter</a>. You can download the library and contribute as needed on GitHub.

Based on Markus Hedlund's <a href="http://github.com/Znarkus/postmark-php/blob/master/Postmark.php">Postmark class for PHP</a>.

<h3>Installation</h3>
Obsolete: see GitHub.

<h3>Usage guide</h3>
Obsolete: see GitHub.

If something goes wrong the library and the Postmark service outputs quite user friendly error messages.

Hopefully this will come in handy for some of you.
