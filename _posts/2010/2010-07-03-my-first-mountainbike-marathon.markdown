Yes, it's <a href="http://www.mtbmaratonbaiamare.ro/">happening</a> today. And even if I'm participating driven by the motto: "somebody has to be last" wish me luck. We're (Ioana and me) both going for the 30 km track which should be easy enough and I even borrowed a full biker costume which fits me perfectly. So I'm all set up. Now I only have to finish 30 km in less than four hours. :-)

<strong>Update:</strong> 9 of 60 and something participants on the 30 km track. A bit better than I expected. :-)
