The older Kindle (and its box) is always on the left.

And now the backstory, or how I ended up owning two Kindle Paperwhites.

I had a second hand Kindle Touch for 2 months equipped with a book light I bought off eBay. But since I read almost exclusively in bed in the dark I used the book light a lot and it just wasn't cutting it and I sort of decided a short while after getting it that I'll upgrade as soon as possible. So on Wednesday when the Paperwhite appeared in stock on the <a href="http://www.altex.ro">website</a> of one of the biggest Romanian electronics stores I quickly ordered it. This was in the morning, then I went in to work and put my Kindle Touch up for sale on the internal mailing list, explaining that I'm selling it because I did an upgrade. A colleague contacted me and asked if the Paperwhite is first generation or the second, I told him it's probably the first and he proceeded to explain me about some illumination issues which were confirmed on Thursday when I received the device. By the way, by noon on Wednesday I have sold the Touch - long live the internal mailing list!

Then one day later Black Friday came and a friend showed me a link on another <a href="http://www.quickmobile.ro">webshop</a>, I said hey, this is the same price, to which he said, yeah but this is the second generation Paperwhite. About 5 minutes later I made an order... So now for a short while I'm the owner of two devices, but I'll return the first gen on Monday.
