Well, hello there and thanks for stopping by!

My name is János Rusiczki and this is my personal space on the Internet, but you probably figured it out already. The guy in the blinding red t-shirt posing in the picture above is me, you caught that right too. So it would be around time to get down to some lesser known facts:

## The basics

- **Birthday:** April 17, 1979 ([my exact age](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=april+17,+1979)).
- **Location:** [Baia Mare, Romania](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=47.6522&lon=23.5652&zoom=13&layers=M).
- **Working as:** Developer at [SoftVision](https://www.cognizantsoftvision.com/).

## Contact details

- **E-Mail:** janos rusiczki net (just add an at sign and a dot).

## Random things, all about me

- I'm married to [Ioana](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ioana) and we have a daughter Anna, [born](https://www.rusiczki.net/2016/02/08/rusiczki-anna-olivia/) on February 8, 2016.
- I like dogs almost as much as I love cats.
- I love tea but don't really drink coffee.
- I ditched my Cola addiction in the spring of 2014.
- I used to try out new beers, but then I stopped drinking alcohol completely around the summer of 2015.
- Musicwise I used to prefer electronic (dance) music (not EDM) but nowadays I'm more like an omnivore.
- I don't really like horror or violent movies. Except if they're directed by Tarantino.

## About the site

Back in the day, the first iteration of this site was built using [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) with lots of customizations and homebrewn scripts. Original color palette help by [Meister Adnan](http://www.adnan.ro/) with additional styling and some header graphics done by [Luci](http://www.lucianmarin.ro/). The link blog section, when it existed, was powered by [delicious](http://del.icio.us/) via their sweet RSS feed (delicious is now long dead - but there are promises it will return).

In the second iteration it was built upon WordPress with a fairly customized template. You can find more information about the upgrade in [this post](http://www.rusiczki.net/2009/04/02/keeping-up-with-the-times/).

Nowadays, as a sort of a back to the roots statement, what you're looking at are HTML files generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) from [these sources](https://github.com/janosrusiczki/janosrusiczki). [Read about the switch.](http://www.rusiczki.net/2018/01/08/a-new-blogging-engine/)

rusiczki.net now rocks **{{ site.posts | size }}** pages of content.
